sorry if this is a stupid question i did try to google it but either sources were beyond me or not quite addressing my question may be a failure of my ability to google knowledge
basically looking for an answer a little more in depth than explain like i am 5
i know that light continues to be visible long after the source has gone out and is constantly moving outward from its origin point at the speed of light
since it does not interact with anything in the vast majority of space it does not change velocity and continues to infinity
the part i am confused about is how interaction with an object then affects that light
we can see things like mars and venus even by the naked eye due to the light reflecting off of the planet
so obviously even with the change of velocity it is possible for the light reach some other objects
is that light still moving at the speed of light
if so why are objects further away dimmer
is it due to light scatter
if the sun were suddenly gone would we continue to see the other planets longer than we would see the light from the sun
unfortunately the truth was not as exciting as the giant canals believed to be on mars
i am wondering what other interesting assumptionstheories the early astronomers had about the other planets and bodies in the solar system
this question has burned inside of me for long enough i need an answer now
perhaps this is against the rules of this subreddit as it is a too simple question but i could not find anything that really answers this question so you probably know how neutron stars are often depicted as these very bright light blue spheres
i had this image and still have it in my head but one time about one and a half years ago my physics teacher told me that neutron stars do not actually emit visible light
if i remember right he told me that it is because of that neutron stars do not do fusion energy anymore
however on another evening he told me that white dwarves do not do either but they glow because of all the heat that is left
but neutron stars are very very hot too even hotter than white dwarves as far as i know
i asked him as well if it could just be because our tools are not good enough to actually take a picture or something alike because they are only 12 or so km in size which is really nothing compared to the they have to earth
unfortunately i do not remember his answer
is he just not informed well enough
i highly doubt it i mean a physics should know what he is talking about
anyways i know that neutron stars emit different frequencies of light but the question is just do they also emit visible light
i need to know if this picture of neutron stars that i and i suppose so many other people have is just a lie
thank you for answers and have a bit of patience with me if i do not understand them right ahead
please join us tonight for some fun live imaging
i am curious if someone can explain to me as lay person not very familiar with tracking planets or moons how we determine the exact date the time of each full and new moon every 15 days
it is obviously not exactly every 15 days that is the whole point of this question how do we know what that slight variation will be for each new moon 1 2 3 4 n moons from now
i see this data all over the internet out to like the year 2100 is the prediction for year 2100 less likely to be exactly right than the prediction for a closer year like 2025
hi
when searching online it says jupitersaturn should be visible with the naked eye during daytime however i cannot see it
i know where the planets are but i cannot see them
i have tried multiple days in a row
a channel i am interested in is being transmitted through eutelsat 8 degrees west longitude
they have that written on their website
for that same satellite there are different bands ku ka and c each with a different coverage map on satbeamscom
i tried to browse through the channel list for the satellite but the channel does not seem to be listed there
to be precise it is listed but just not on the band i am interested in
my question is for a given channel transmitted through a certain satellite does it transmit through all its different bands
the channel i am interested in is being transmitted through eutelsat 8 w but is not listed on satbeamscom so i am wondering if it is a matter of inaccuracy from the website or something about how different bands work
thank you so much
hello everyone ampx200b i am a total noob in astronomy and need some help
how can one tell whether or not an object can be seen through a telescope using celestial coordinates ie
right ascension and declination
ampx200b the best thing i have found is something written by the university of toronto
it does tell that when the declination of an object is within a certain range then the object can be seen
however if an object is not within this range it just skips over how to use the right ascension and tell us to rather use a website because it involves complex math
but that is exactly what i need
ampx200b i could not find anything else online to solve my problem
so if anyone could answer my question or tell me where to find the appropriate ressources i would greatly appreciate it
ampx200b edit for those who may want the answer i converted the right ascension and the declination in azalt coordinates and then you just have to check whether the altitude is between 0 and 90 degrees
hello astronomers while looking at the telescope alignment image i had noticed these two objects in close proximity to the star
what might these objects be
they seem different from the other stars in the image
thanks
ampx200b both objects on left side
almost two hours ago i was out for a walk when i noticed a bright light to my right and saw a very bright object falling down
suddenly it broke up into several smaller pieces and shortly after i could not see more because a building was blocking the view
at first i wondered if it was one of those parachute rockets that one can find if buying fireworks but it was moving a little too fast and the direction did not feel right
this was before it fell apart and i realized it was definitely not firework
it felt pretty close but i could not hear anything from it not even when it fell apart
i have read that when a meteor split into several parts it usually happens with a bang
if so it must have been further away than i assumed
but it was so bright it felt much closer
i just remember back in the days when we all see the close surface high res of jupiter surface
it was bizarre but also excited
it gave me the chilled on the bone and how scary it looks
now looking further to the remaining planets in our solar system i cannot wait to see how it will look like with saturn uranus neptune
how was it like when we saw the picture of pluto
was the satellite passed close over pluto compare to the other 3

good day fellow enthusiasts i have just recently been thrust into the magnificent world of amateur astronomy and i am very anxious about making everything as perfect as possible
it is not that i do not have any knowhow i do theoretically since i have been interested in this from my early childhood and i am also now a physics major at an undergrad level who takes additional courses in astronomy but am overwhelmed with the practical aspect of observation
my first and only telescope is a celestron power seeker 127eq i am having it shipped over via amazon and i now fear in which condition it is going to arrive in
i am thinking that it must be misaligned and am thus wondering whether or not i need to buy a collimator alongside it
i looked into multiple collimating options be it with a laser one cheshire or with homemade caps with small hole in the center
i now wonder what the best option for me is should i buy one of those collimators
would it be sufficient for me just to eyeball it with the homemade abomination of a collimating eyepiece andor do a startest ie
defocusing a bright star and trying to make all the emergent circles concentric
i have invested a pretty penny into this telescope and thus i am hesitant of any other further expenses
also the telescope is coming any day now so even if i order a collimator now it would take some time to get here so i would have to wait which would just prolong my overthinkinginduced problems
anyways thank you all for reading all the way through and if you have any and i mean any suggestions or opinions please write them right here
i have a video from 11 years ago in which i showed how it sounded when you imported the executable file of ms paint into an audio program
it sounded really cool and strange due to there being a lot of raw bitmap icon data stored in the executable files resources
here it is but people started commenting on my video claiming they have heard this as nereids sound
apparently someone stole my exact audio from my video it has all my specific edits intact mixed in some ethereal sounds and uploaded it pretending it was the sound of neptunes moon nereid
now i know there are legitimate sounds recorded from planets electromagnetic emissions
but there is zero doubt that people have stolen my audio to make a fake nereids sound
i found a few examples on youtube but by now it is apparently somewhat in the internet collective consciousness which is scary because it is an example of how fast misinformation propagates
example 1 example 2 example 3 and that is just 3 there is a lot more i think
i have heard other supposed sounds from moons that have very similar sounding audio those could easily be fake as well but i cannot be 100 sure with those like i am with this one
i am making this post because i wanted to reach as many people as possible to dispel this misinformation
thank you for taking a look at this
edit the person who originally stole the sound was just like 11 or 12 when they did it and they have apologized and given me credit however that does not mean this misinformation will immediately completely disappear so i am keeping this post up
but do not harass them they are just a kid
i have been searching around for a good place to take my son star gazing outside of breckenridge co down a long road i came across this feature from sat view
it looks like a random star park what do you guys think
i did not even consider taking my rig on the trip but did not know one actually existed nearby
star park or not
so here is the thing
i am not an astronomer
i am not a musician
i am a devop with some special interests and try to do stuff i find comfort in
that is space and music
i kind of want to combine it and am learning stuff
the first experiment i made is a tool which reads pixelinformation and generates a midi file out of it
i wrote a blog post about this and then i have gone a step further and made actual sounds out of it maybe someone likes this idea

hey reddit
edit this post is mod approved so i did this last year on rfree where i made star maps for people to mark the special occasions of their lives and now that summer has started and i have some free time on my hands i would love to do that again on this subreddit since people here i figured might appreciate this offer more i do not really think i would need to define what a star map is over here but since i did that the last time i guess i might as well do it again so a star map really is a representation of the sky consisting of the constellations planets the moon and the sun as seen from a specific location during a given time
this makes it so that they are not only an excellent tool to guide us around the nightsky but they also make up for excellent souvenirs to treasure those specials moments of our lives
here are some examples of star maps these images are not mine 1 2 3 ill be making them for absolutely free
all you have to do is leave a comment and wait for me to get back to you via dms
i will eventually get back to everyone till i mark this post closed
 i am doing this only because last year when i did this on rfree i was completely overwhelmed by the reaction of people and how they sent me photos of them using the star maps as a dcor around their house it really made my summer also a few people decided to tip which i then used to buy courses on udemy would like to state that though that tips are no necessary
thanks for reading
happy stargazing wishing you a happy summer and dark skies
so i am going to do some astrophotography at the end of the month
i am thinking about going back to natural bridges national park in utah
from my time there last year i had zero cell phone signal
this year i would like to have some kind of outside communication since my wife will be staying home and she is pregnant
anyone have any good recommendations on a way to get wifi
if not any suggestions on a satellite phone
greetings everyone
i have been wondering about this for some time but i cannot manage to get a straight answer from the internet
searching astronomic calendar only shows me a calendar of astronomical events such as visible planets and other objects at a certain moment of the year
and elaborating more the question to the search engine only gives me more trending topics without a trace of an answer
so here is my reflection
excuse me beforehand if i fall into noobish presumptions about the topic this not my field of expertise nor my main hobby
also sorry if i lack the technical english vocabulary to express myself with accuracy
soooo the premises 1 earth orbits the sun
okay
okay
this orbit is the yearly cycle
2 the firmament is static around the solar system
well the system orbits the center of the galaxy but i understand that the scale of this orbit is so big spacetime wise that we can consider our system static during our lifespan
correct me here if i am wrong
3 while orbiting the sun the earth also rotates on its polar axis
the dayly cycle
premises over the table time for the thought so at a certain time of the year the day sky and night sky will be the same regardless of the observers longitude
only latitude will make you see a different sun course during the day and the same for stars visibility in the night
so far this makes sense to me knowing the longer daynight cycles are the closer you go to the earths poles and the existence of the polar star which was used in the past to locate the north because it is always above the north pole
conclussion
 romans defined their zodiac constelations belt from rome and as long as you live at a close altitude of that of rome you will be able to see all of the constelations consistently over the year
 and if the firmament is fixed around the solar system then the same constelations will be visible always at the same seasons maybe with slight differences over the course of the years
 so from my country spain the most visible constellations i can see these days are scorpio and aries and some more should be visible in a clear night with no building around
next year around these same dates i should be able to see these guys aproximately in the same manner
and if i observe week after week month after month the evolution of the zodiac belt and get used to it over time in a future i should be able to tell if summer is coming or if we are still midwinter just by looking the constellations without having a proper calendar at hand
i mean it sounds obvious to me that if a culture defined a set of constelations was mainly in order to guide themselves over the seasons
greeks did it before romans and chinese did it too and for sure many more
it is just the fact that i am unable to see any reference to this on the internet makes me wonder if am i inventing pure nonsense or is the world around me losing the roots of awesome metodology and knowledge
i hope this reflection entertained you and a response will be helpful
edit correction for correct use of longitude and latitude terms

why is it great and why is it worth travelling there
bonus points if it is an interesting or fun place during the day as well
i am trying to figure out if i remember this factoid right
years ago in an astronomy class i took we watched a short video that talked about each of the planets
i could have sworn that the video said that we were lucky that saturn was not any bigger because if it was it would have been rivals with jupiter and thrown the whole solar system into chaos
as it stands now jupiters larger size wards meteors off and away from earth without being destructive with its gravitational force
am i remembering this right
i cannot for the life of me find this video so i am turning to the experts for clarification
thank you
i live in wy so at 1115 mountain time i was walking back up to my house the moon was covered by our hill so i could see lots of stars
i look over to the constellation lynx and in between talitha borealis and talitha australias i saw a very bright star
it seemed brighter then sirius and it was quite big
so i took out my phone and looked on my star app that tells me what star is what
and as i look up to position my phone the bright star quickly gets smaller smaller and dimmer and dimmer until i could not see it anymore
i have basically gone down a rabbit hole of options but none of them seem like it
if anyone has any info that would be so helpful
so i worldbuild for fun and one of the ideas i had for my universe involved a planet with mostly bronzeage technology beginning to practice astronomy more and more
i am posting here about it because i liked the idea of another goldilocks planet sharing the same sun and being equidistant from it as the world i have mentioned but not only do the two planets rarely see each other but their orbits are perpendicular to one another as opposed to being on the same flat plane like a normal orbit
barring the scientific plausibility of 3d solar systems would the other planet look like a comet without a tail on the rare occasion it is visible from the other planet
would it be possible for the planets to get close enough to each other to observe each others specific geography without them colliding or worse pulling each other
thanks for any and all answers you may have and if i worded something poorly let me know
in past years i have gotten up very early 3 am cst to watch the perseid meteor showers
i live near milwaukee wisconsin so to avoid city lights i watch from the lakeshore beach where bluffs block out the western third of the sky and the city lights
from what i have read the showers will peak on august 1113 this year
however there will also be a bright moon
between my limited sky view and the moon i am trying to determine if any of those days is better than the others and if my usual 35 am watch period is good
based on this moonrisemoonset calculator the moon will be going down in the southsouthwest shortly before sunrise
if i watch a couple days earlier i will get less moon but also miss the peak days for the showers
 any recommendations on optimizing the experience would be appreciated
i took my 4yearold daughter a couple years ago and it was one of the best memories of the year 
hello i cannot seem to find much info out there regarding how seeing conditions affect high magnification amatuer telescopes
does it affect higher magnification ie
my telescopes max magnification more
is it worthwhile for a casual telescope user to purchase a max magnification eyepiece if they live in the city and does not really control astronomy time
ampx200b context have celestron evolution 8 2030mm focal length 8inch mirror
stated max magnification is about x480 so i am thinking about purchasing a 45mm eyepiece for x450 evolution pretty much magnification to the max
here is the problem i messed aorubd with tring and adapter and all of that when at some point the ring inside the tring fell went loose it fits into the tring but it is not fixated falls out
here are the photos of what it looks like
have i lost some parts or what
how can i fix it
 so i have a big telescope celestron cpc 1100 f10 focal length 2800 mm more info here 
and i have been trying to take photographs with my sony a7c dslr camera but i cannot get perfect focus
now here comes more problems i do not know if it is a cameraback focus or a calibration problem
this is the photo i get when i take a photo of the moon photo of leaves with my dslr camera a tring and a tadapter
this is the most focused i can get it to be yet with an eyepiece the moon is clear and in perfect focus
then it could not be a calibration problem right
now that night since it was perfectly focused w eyepiece on the moon i tried to focus this telescope on a bright star and came to a bigger problem cannot get it to be focused on the star in general
the star cannot reach a focus where it is a small dot the closest i could get the star to focus was this it is similar with dslr photo as looking through the eyepiece give or take
this is where i might think it is a calibration problem
today i tried to get the camera focused with a 2x barlow lens this is the photo the focus i got and the setup
and i tried to insert the barlow halfway only the tip every length i got it into the telescope it would still reach that same bad focus
so basically this barlow only increased the focus problem rather than help
unless i did something wrong
i do not know what to do and how to get my camera to focus on objects from the telescope
what could be the problem
anyone have any suggestions what i should do and look into
if gravity is what causes the air to be stuck around the planet and gravity is also what caused said body to be round if an body which is not circular happens to have an atmosphere of very light gasses is it possible that the atmosphere only exists in ceirtain parts of the body not considering height variations 
according to every source i have looked at centaurus constellation is a southern hemishere constellation only visible between 25 and 90 latitudes but i am able to see a portion of it on the horizon in south carolina approx 33 lat
i checked with with sky guide apps to varify that i was identifying it correctly
is that range based only on the visibility of the entire constellation
hi
i made a periodic table of constellations with their iau deisgnated names

i was trying to guess what would be in the first batch of images coming from jwst and i thought would not it be awesome if it was the pillars of creation but in 8k ultra super imax
so i took out my phone and started up open sky and low and behold what is directly opposite the sun right nowthe eagle nebula and a whole bunch of messier objects towards the galactic center
so as i was looking through the internet to see if that was true i came across a picture of the craft and i just realized it does not point out but it looks forward which as i think about makes a whole lot of sense because forward minimizes the movement of the sky
so do i have this basically correct and if the jwst is not looking out does that rule out the galactic center as a direction it can be looking at this month
also so i can seem like less of an idiot what is the proper term for out and forward
edit now that i am thinking about it more it is more that it is looking to the side instead of out because that gives you full coverage of the sky for every orbit around the sun by rotating the craft along an axis at the center of the sun shield
 i know this is also a bit of a planetary geology question as well but since it does deal with space physics amp there is not an active sub for planetary geology i thought here might be a decent place to ask or at least a decent place to start
in a lot of the photos from the multiple rovers on mars when we see rocks they exhibit an interesting feature
small amp medium sized rocks are lodged on the surface with almost no sanddust deposits resting on or around them
over millions of years uninterrupted how is this possible
weathering amp erosion would have only added to the quantity of sand over millions of years creating a layer of strata with heavier rocks beneath
large flat rocks also do not exhibit signs of sanddust deposits on their flat area
are they vibrating upward to the surface
or is material being plumed into space during martian dust storms rather than depositing on the surface
our deserts show how much sand can be accumulated in just a 12000 year period
if left untouched for millions years why do we see this phenomena on mars
does it have something to do with its emf amp relative lack or gravity
edit here are photo examples of what i am talking about img 1 img 2 img 3 img 4 img 5 img 6

 i know jupiter has powerful radiation belts but i am wondering if there are places within the magnetosphere that are relatively calm
i am asking about jupiter a gas giant we know because i am curious as to whether a gas giant in general could have a magnetosphere that would protect a moon from solar radiation
if a moon of a gas giant is in a calmer area of the planets magnetic field not inside a radiation belt would the planets magnetosphere protect it from the stars radiation
or are all parts of the planets magnetosphere heavily irradiated
heading into the desert this weekend with a bunch of humans
it would be fun to be able to regale them with fun stories of the cosmos as we gaze skyward
as the title of the post says i would like to hear from people who have had experience with viewing the night sky at bortle 1 parksnature preservesother publiclyaccessible locations in the lower 48 states
where do you think is the best place to go to view bortle 1 skies
hi there i am looking for a way to download the simbad database or a similar star catalogue containing star positions and velocities
i want to use it to write a programme to visualise the change in the appearance of constellations over time
does anyone know how i can obtain a machinereadable copy of this database
if not is there a database which would be suitable for my purposes and how can i go about obtaining it
many thanks
there has been a lot of comparisons of the hubble and james webb telescopes
i was wondering when the hubble telescope become operational did they have any idea what it is replacement would be like
did nasa want to create the webb telescope but technology just was not advanced enough
was it computing power
was the technology not even invented yet
what limitations were there that the hubble was the best design
i live in brisbane aus
i was looking 280 degrees west at around 600 pm 26622
i am lost for words
it is like i watched a tree i never knew i always looked at just fade away before my very eyes
i would love some opinions or anything to quell my confused state because what the 
i am from the uk does anyone know where there are good spots to stargaze in the berkshire area for some reason to only things i can find online are places nominated as great places i just want some where simple nearby that i do not have to travel across the country for
thank you in advance
is anyone able to fill me in on whether or not tessera of venus and lobate scarps of mercury are substantially different from one another
finding information on these features is a bit difficult especially comparing the two so i thought i would ask here
pardon me if this is too basic of a question

hey guys currently i am working on a review paper about gravitational waves and i read that the principle of superposition is not applicable for gravitational waves because of the nonlinearity of einsteins field equation
but what happens if two gravitational waves collide
are they just pass by each other
i already did some research but i could not find anything
i would be very grateful if anyone can help me with this question or knows a source to look it up
so first let me say that space objects like the moon appear just fine
that said i have been using the telescope lately to look at hillside like 23 miles away
things definitely appear largely magnified on the hill but they are blurry not well focused
why are terrestrial objects like that blurry in a telescope like this and is there any way to fix it
is it a problem with the telescope itself

open the post to see the photo 
for me i would have to say m51a is my favorite because it both cool to photograph over on rastrophotography but also to look through a telescope at those beautiful spiral arms
i will graduate in the coming months and will likely send some phd applications for the next admissions cycle
i plan to use the next year or so to gain any useful experience i can
what sort of positions should i look for
would appreciate any thoughts
i feel like it is been burning brighter lately hotter and i have a feeling it is halfway through life and maybe that is why
i am in no shape or form an astrologist so sorry in advance if this sounds stupid
in 7th grade science class we would cover a lot of ground scientifically whether it is biology physics chemistry and so on
and most of the class found it invariably boring but once we got to space and astronomy there was nothing but intrigue
our teacher waa bombarded with questions about space that she would answer to the best of her ability and it got to the point where she would have to shut them down because it was getting away from the course material too much
and she shut them down in future lectures whenever things were indirectly connected to space
let this be a lesson that it is hard not to love and be intrigued by outer space
i think you would have a hard time finding someone who thinks space is just meh
i just bought the nexstar 8se
i am wondering how others found theirs after shipping collimation wise
i am new to these types of scopes as i have only had reflectors so far
should i be concerned with collimation before that first session
do these hold collimation longer than my dobs do
i find that i usually hear about the events after they happen where do i go so i can be prepared to see the next thing
i am a student and i am developing a nonpayed planetarium software for my final project
i have made a 1 minute survey to see what i need to prioritise to make an intuitive lightweight program that works for all types of astronomers

i have only had a few responses so far so all responses regardless of astro experience are appreciated
thanks for reading
edit thanks everyone for all the responses i have 65 so far
please still respond though the more responses i get the better data i will have to help with decisions regarding features and ui

 i do not often drop 2 podcast episodes in one day okay i never have
but you do not want to miss comet c2017 k2 panstarrs in the southeast skies now and making a close approach to earth on july 14th
that is a very special day in our home listen to this backyard astronomer special edition to find out more
yesterday night at around 11 pm pst i spotted something that started flashing gradually flashing brighter then dimmer and eventually disappearing
i do not have accurate measurements but it was spotted towards the northeast in yosemite slightly north of yosemite falls at around 70 degrees high
it does not seem to be a satellite since it stayed completely still the entire time
it was rapidly flashing at around once per 2 seconds lasting a total of about 15 seconds before disappearing completely
i am completely puzzled as to what this is most pulsing stars described online seem to have really long periods
i do not have much experience in astronomy so sorry in advance if the answer is really obvious
edit exact location 377661698 119601699
is it like images that would be exciting for even average people who know very little about the subject or is it like more datay images that are exciting but mostly for people who are involved in the field
i have known about jwst for awhile but only the past week or so have i gotten really excited and looked more into the details of it
i know next to nothing about astronomyastrophotography i am just an engineering student who thinks space stuff is really cool
my dad bought me a celestron astromaster 114 for christmas about 10 years ago
me being a stupid 10yearold could never figure out how to use it and now it is spent a decade gathering dust in our reading room
we recently went to a dark sky park and got some great views of the milky way and needless to say we are hooked
so with his birthday coming up i decided to get my telescope and try to restore it
we lost the lens cap some years back but i still have the 10mm and 20mm eyepieces
i am not seeing the spotting sight although i am not sure that was even in the box back then
so other than replacing those are there any accessories that are worthwhile to enhance our experience
how do you recommend cleaning it
is there a way i should disassemble it and clean all the important parts
it still seems to be in great shape at least as far as i can tell but i imagine the mirrors are pretty dusted up due to having no protection
i have a celestron nextar 6se and currently have it in my garage
is it ok to keep in there if it gets really hot during the summer or should i keep it inside
i love stargazing it is really enjoyable for me but what i want to ask you guys is how do you keep yourselves more entertained
i get real excited about it drive miles and miles away to get a good view and do not get me wrong i love it but once i get there it gets kind of boring fast after like 30 minutes the awe and sublime does not go away but there is just this feeling like there is nothing to do
i will be out in the middle of nowhere at like 2 am by myself just staring at the sky and i like it but i just start to feel kind of bored fast i do not know if i am just not cut out for it or what lol but i always end up traveling hours for a great view then leaving in like 40 minutes and i feel like that is kind of sad
maybe it is because i do not have anybody i know who is into astronomy so i am always out there by myself and it is just the loneliness getting to me
is there an agreed upon collective noun for a group of astronomers
or stargazers
if not what would you call those groups
for example a murder of crows a pride of lions a damning of jurors
sprite hello there
we are a group of students from poland
for several months we have been operating a bolide station that is part of pfn polish fireball network
we have 2 cameras and mainly we observe asteroids and analyze them
a few days ago we observed this strange phenomenon
did someone else observe sprite and would like to tell us observation time gt 2124 30062022 gmt2 is it rare or something else
thanks pfn14 group sprite gif
i once recall there is a 6 letter abbreviation for this type of observation when a object causes the star to appear dim
i think there is the letters m o and p in this acronym
any thoughts on what i am thinking of
edit its been about a decade but perhaps i was thinking of this 
i am trying to understand seasons but i cannot for the life of me grasp it
so the earth has an equator which is perpendicular to its axis
it could be said that anyone above this line is experiencing summerwinter while anyone below the equator is experiencing the opposite
this cannot hold true however because of the earths tilt
what is the name of the imaginary line which describes this while taking the earths tilt into account
a line which perfectly divides those experiencing summer from those experiencing winter0 apologies for the lack of clarity my understanding of this is very weak
title states it
i tried a google search but got conflicting answers
one place said the sun orbits around the milky way
if the sun is not stationary does that mean that stars are not always in the same place in the sky year to year for us
thanks
as the title says i have just observed neptune for the first time and wanted to share my excitement
just like seeing saturn and jupiter for the first time i was overcome with excitement and must have spent the last 20 minutes tracking it through the night sky
i saw the article on wikipedia with a gross misinformation right at the start
natural color it says and there is an image made through nonrgb filters and edited so hard it looks nothing like the real thing
so i went to edit this out but could not find the real thing
it is almost impossible to find the it in decent resolution
the best one i could find is this edited crummy image from voyager 1 or maps wrapped around digital spheres
the nutters who are gatekeeping wikipedia articles would rather have something unrealistic but taken through a camera than something that is way informative
ampx200b nasa really made a huge mess with this
europa has no red stripes
no orange stripes
no blue or lemon yellow patches
no strong colors and no strong contrasts
it is icy regolith with cracks and traces of tholins
when you search for europa in true color and variations of the phrase you even get totally misleading articles where one less crazy color image is deemed as true because it is set against one with very crazy colors
it should not be so hard
cassini had a rich filter wheel on its powerful telescope and i am sure it delivered red blue and green data
it just needs to be properly assembled yet nobody bothered to do so
let us try to find it and change the misinformation on wikipedia
july 12 2022 1030am edt 1430 gmt or on july 11 2022 5pm edt 2100 utc nasa website says both
what prevents these shells from mixing
i have been using the tidal locking equation to try and work out how long it would take a satellite to tidally lock to its parent body
it seems to work as i get a value of 100000000 years for the moon however i then get a figure of only 50000 years for ganymede which seems too short a duration by several orders of magnitude
i have looked for literature on this and it seems sparse
please if known can someone tell me how long ganymede is believed to have taken to tidally lock to jupiter
it is obvious what kind of a mauling that kind of compression subjects an image to we have only to scrutinise a jpeg image fairly closely to discern that ugly jpeggy shimmering probably roughly a more complex form of the gibbs phenomenon in fourier series representation around objects to learn for ourselves what that kind of compression does to an image
and images of astronomical vistas replete with subtle tendrils of nebular formation and yet also with some extremely sharp transitions are just about the most vulnerable of all images to that kind of mauling really jpeggery is only suited when the idea is for folk to see the image amp go yep there is that house or train or plane involved in that incident
or something like that amp immediately moveon
in the days of micro sd cards that can hold 128gb and the routine dowloading of youtube videos comprising literally tens of gb it would be insane to the point of criminal for nonother than images compressed in that manner to be available in stupid amp idolatrous deference to that zombieish rote litany to the effect of jpeg images are perfectly adequate for all practical purposes
that seems to have installed itself everywhere as some kind of contagion kindof reminiscent of how light can travel for many millions or even some billions of years across the universe prettymuch unmarred amp then literally be scrambled in the last millisecond by atmospheric effects except deliberately amp perversely broughton 
some news titles say its the deepest we have ever seen
on nasa website it says it is the deepest infrared
and they talk about the cluster it captured which they say is only 46 billion light years away
some articles say there is a galaxy over 13 billion light years away on the picture yet i did not see it written on the nasa website
so is it actually the deepest we have ever seen
or are just media doing as if it was the deepest ever and they just overlook the word infrared
because i remember an image from hubble that actually showed a faint galaxy over 13 billion light years away i am just not sure can you please clarify this for me
thanks
i know that the lmc is 158000 ly away at a declension of 70 degrees but i do not know how to interpret that
if i were to observe from a planet within the cloud would the milky way fill up the sky like a giant dinner plate
be a fuzzy band across the sky
i know andromeda is faintly visible from here so i imagine we would be visible to the lmc but i do not have the right data to imagine
i have not been able to find a satisfactory explanation for how the jwst light path works in relation to all the different instruments
this link says that all pickoff mirrors are fixed and in the focal plane
does this mean that each instrument is only getting a fraction of collected light
does this imply that the equivalent primary mirror size that each instrument sees is much smaller than the actual full primary mirror
if anyone can help alleviate my confusion i would be grateful 
i was looking forward to the first official images of the james webb but i am kind of disappointed
they look amazing for sure but this is not anything we have seen before in fact hubble has taken the same images before only this time it shows more with higher detail and resolution which of course is cool to see but in the end it mostly shows the capabilities of james webb and these were just a taste of what is to follow and the improvements over hubble
ampx200b i was waiting for something that could not be done before a james webb power move which is why in the end i was the most exciting over the atmospheric composition graph of the hot jupiter planet
that was something new and holds a lot promise
ampx200b oh and the nasa live stream is always so horrible with everyone having some fake smile and stretching time with cringy sugar talk like how people have seen their reflection in jw mirrors uniting us all blah blah
just have a scientist calmly break down every image on what scientific importance it holds
90 of what they say holds no value
ok this might be a dumb question but i was wondering what is the optical physical reason behind seeing most pictured stars displaying 6 distinct rays of light around them
i am thinking of hosting a party to celebrate the autumn equinox
what would be some fun community events
this has always be an important social event
any advice suggests or antidotes people can share
ampx200b
this wikipedia article on the most distant astronomical objects implies that the most distant observable object is a galaxy
but is there some phenomenon that is observable beyond that
for example if we looked far enough would the cmb from the last scattering from the reionization period look different
hi
my first post here
yes i did read the rules and i did a small amount of googling to no avail
i am looking for a moderately technical description think scientific american level of the actual data webb collects and how the scientists convert this data into the color images we see all over the net
any links pointing to same will be much appreciated
thanks and have a beautiful day
good day to you all i am a student currently doing summer research at california state university chico california
my project consists of hooking up and controlling a skywatcher neq6 pro telescope mount in order to view a solar eclipse that is going to happen in a couple of months out in the pacific ocean
our current issue is that we ordered and received the incorrect rj12tousb cable for connecting to the synscan remote to our computer in order to be controlled through eqascom
we now believe that it would be better if we connect our pc directly to the mount using a 9pin serialtousb cable instead
this type of cable is specially made for connecting to telescope mounts
filecusersbeguerralynx20astro20ftdi20eqdir20usb20adapter20for20skywatcher20eq620or20neq620syntrek20amp20pro20mounts2020first20light20opticsfileslynxastroeqdirswdsubnewjpg unfortunately most suppliers of this cable are overseas and ordering from them would mean we would have to wait about a month to receive it
time we do not have due to the fact the telescope must be ready and shipped out by midaugust
if anyone has this type of cable we would be willing to compensate you if you were willing to lend or sell it to us
additionally if you know anyone that might have what we are looking for we would really appreciate it if you could get us into contact
thank you for taking the time to read through this
perusing threads in rastrophotography a commenter mentioned that under no circumstances must one look at the sun with any sort of magnified equipment
the reasons are obvious one may be blinded as a result
this brings me to my question how is it possible for astrophotographers to take such defined photos of the sun without destroying their sensors
i am even more curious about the big honkers astronomers play around with like those massive scopes in hawaii and on top of mountains etc
how do they manage to observe the sun without annihilating hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars in gear
perhaps it is a matter of having an algorithm and imaging technique that can filter out the mirroredbent light in just a way to acquire an image of the earth in the far past
the amount of time in the past we could see would be 2x the light years we are from that black hole
it was explained to me that the circular pattern exhibited in the latest jwts image is due to gravitational lensing and not a fisheye type effect of the imaging and i was curious to get more insight about this
crude illustration if this is indeed lensing what are these galaxies lensing around that would produce this overall circular pattern
and why is the lensing so uniform in this circular pattern
it is my understanding that light gets bent on its way to the observer when something of gravitational significance is in front of it or in between the object and the observer
but the whole image seems to be converging to this circular pattern
if the jwts were pointed in a different direction would the same circular patternlensing occur

hi i am a year 9 going into year 10 and my head of science has let me organize an astronomy club during school times which i am over the moon about
i have a few activities in mind but what are some that would be enjoyable and educative for years 710
i have a 10 inch dobsonian that i plan to pull out of storage for tonight to try to show my nephews the comet
it looks like we should have about 45 minutes between the time it gets dark and the time the moon comes up to try to get a glimpse of the comet
i have a uhcs lens filter that i can use if that would help
any suggestions on what lens size to use to get the best view
we are viewing in a bortle 5 location
so i know webb was specifically designed to peer back in time and observe the earliest galaxies and their formations
so far we have found nothing of the sort resembling young galaxies
all the galaxies we have seen are fully formed and mature when they should not be
furthermore we have not seen a reduced number of galaxies as expected
it has only been more galaxies beyond the celestial bodies imaged
this was very surprising to the researchers
as noted here for me what was surprising about stephans quintet was just how many galaxies are in the background says jane rigby webbs operations project scientist at nasas goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland
to add everywhere i have looked on the topic of early galaxies and previous research on them i have only seen predictions being defied
they are always fully formed
so my question is what are the implications of this
what if we just continue finding fully formed galaxies
what then
what would planetary rings look like from the surface of a rocky planet
could they change color depending on how the sun reflects on them
we have an idea for a planet with rings that transition from red to blue and back to red throughout the year and id like if that would be possible
if this are not relevant please refer me to a subreddit where that is more appropiate
thanks
not as flashy as some of the other posts on this subreddit but for me who lives in a light congested area it was spectacular and i am very happy right now wish i could have taken a video of it though but i was so bedazzled ha
the main reason i got into astronomy was my interest in nasa global defence project against phas and other neos
is there anything whether it be a software website database where i can view and track these objects
perhaps a thing i can download into kstars
any reccomendation for getting into it without a telescope is welcomed too
i want to print the high res webb deep field image on a metal plate do any of you have experience in what the difference is between a cheap versus expensive option
is artbeat studios that much better than say canvasdiscount
if a galaxy is 13 billion light years away given the expansion of the universe it definitely is not 13 billion years old it is probably 510 billion years old i do not know the maths hence it is not among the oldest galaxies
the oldest ones would probably be much farther away
correct me if i am wrong
i just learned about this phenomenon in imaging the furthest galaxies thanks to jwst and the great members of this community
for the uninitiated beyond a certain distance the angular dimension of objects start getting larger rather than smaller i am trying to understand it is relation to the expansion of the universe
does this graph tell us the exact rate of speed of expansion of the universe over time
will the turnover point currently at redshift of 15 or about 95 and 145 billion light years of lighttravel time and proper distance respectively shift as the rate of expansion continues to accelerate or does it stay constant
hey all i have got a cheapo powerseeker 70az with some upgraded lenses and a homemade wooden tripod that i took up into the boise foothills last night to try to spot the comet
it is my second time taking the telescope out and i had a heck of a time trying to spot the comet
i used stellarium to find it and i think i was pointing at the right nearby stars but after 2 hours of searching i could not find anything cometlike
i was spotting with a 32mm plossl which i feel gave me a slightly wider view than my 6mm svbony
what can i do to improve my workflow here
is my scope just too underpowered
it was not a total loss i found saturn quite easily and it was my first time seeing the rings with the svbony
although it just looked like a teeny little ringed star it was still amazing and now i must see more
just took them out of the box
the right lens is working fine but the left one is completely black
is this normal or do i need to return them
thank you
personally i admire him
i think he has the best knowledge of astrophysics
i have a couple of his books and love them
i know there will be opinions coming that are the polar opposite of mine but as long as no personal attacks happen i would love to debate them
hi everyone a while back i read a nasa article about the use of lasers retroreflectors on the moon to test the legitimacy of equivalence and so theory of gravity i was wondering if anyone knew any more about this work what came from it all
i have struggled to find much online left uni so can no longer access published papers 
is there any software out there that would allow me to do this using a web based tool is kind of annoying
something to track neos and other asteroids and comets
ampx200b cheers guys
are we or would it make sense to be looking for the same objects in different parts of the sky
analogous to an object located at the north pole on a sphere emitting light that travels on the surface of the sphere it would be seen by looking directly toward the north pole and also by looking toward the south pole
i know this cannot be a new idea or anything i am just curious if we are trying to look for evidence of the same object in different locations in the sky and if we are how is that going
haha
i recently have been fascinated with astronomy and just finished the crash course astronomy series on youtube
i loved how the topics we are broken down into focusedmanageable pieces although i did watch at 75 speed so i could understand better
i also found phil a pretty entertaining host
now i am curious what should i watch next
i appreciate any recommendations
if this is not the best sub for this question which it very well may not be kindly direct me to a more appropriate sub
if one were to find themselves within say the bootes void would one be able to see any light from without
i know it is not a black hole and so light can make its way in without being destroyed but if you were in the very center of one such void would the naked eye be able to glimpse star light
bootes is thought to be roughly spherical with a radius of approx
115 million lys so huge but not unusually so by astronomical standards
this may be a dumb question and i may be communicating it poorly but it is something i have been thinking about since the jw images were released
thoughts
if i was to leave earth and travel to a planet x 10 light years away at 99999 the speed of light an observer from earth would not see me arrive at planet x until 20 years in the future assuming it takes ten years to get there and ten years for the light to return to planet earth
if i then returned to planet earth at the same speed a moment after i arrived on planet x then would not an observer from earth see me arrive at planet x then back at planet earth a moment later 
or ten years later 
and how long did the journey actually take me from my perspective and how long from an earth observers perspective
this is the reason i joined reddit so any attempt at an answer would be much appreciated even piss takes
i really have i spent 52 days not doing this
anyone knows any astronomy book club on reddit or
just somewhere chill to communicate with fellow space lovers
i have been taking photos since last week of the sun especially that huge great sun spot from a few days ago i am a real noob when it comes to taking photos and only posted a couple of my best ones
i do not have the right equipment to take long exposures at the moment and these are 25ms exposures with a bit of post processing to adjust the contrast
all in all i am pretty pleased with it
the smudge anf 2 left most spots are camera artifacts amd a bit of dirt
apperently the sun is very active now and according to some scetchy article in my native language a solar storm hit us 25th of june and made a crack in the magnetosphere
apperently one of the biggest one in recent history and according to the article it came as a surprise to astronomers is this true
if true where was this crack made
and would the people below it have take steps to avoid being hit by alot more radiation then normal
could this cracking of our magnetosphere speed up the overdue poleshift
do you think they will be able to better see the planets in orbit
i am new to this sub and i apologise if this question has been asked many times before
if light is the fastest travelling object we know how is it that we can look back in time and observe the beginnings of the universe while still existing now
if the light of early universe events has not reached us yet how is it possible that we exist in physical form before that light
edit does the light emitted from the big bang travel faster than the expansion of the universe
generally binary systems for when a group of stars is created all at once
but is there a way that a younger star eventually meets an older star and a form a binary system later in its life
how would that happen
could it happen before 5 billion years
what data determined that in roughly 5 billion years this will occur to our star
thanks
so i have a random question with all these talks of the pictures released from nasa by jwst
so these galaxies stars etc are like 40 million light years away so that light must have left these galaxies 40 million years ago which means things have obviously changed
so are there any tests or processes to predict what is happening now to objects that far away
or would that require bigger and more powerful computers to basically simulate the universe based on physics we know
i tried googling this but i do not even know how to word my question lol
hopefully this makes sense to people that know astronomy way better than i do
apologies in advance for not knowing how to word stuff
is there some kind of repository that all of jwsts images can be viewed at by the public
i follow webb on all of its available social media platforms but i am curious if there is a less cluttered way to view its data
sorry if there is an obvious answer i am missing i cannot seem to find a good site on nasagov or any other webbsite genius i know
thanks
i need some ideas for isef international science and engineering fair
i like astrophysics but i do not have access to big labs
if someone could link me some important or novel papers or specifically someone involved with isef could pm me that would be awesome

it is a terrible video but right at 2 sec you see one
and it happens again in the same vicinity
will the upcoming solar storms aurora be visible from london
i searched in several places but could not find an answer
i am thinking of trying to do some data analysis on astronomical data using python or some other appropriate language
are there repositories of raw data that nonacademics have access to
the eagle nebula in sho taken with the officina stellare crc 312 320 f54 qhy 600 pro 5nm chroma filters and on the incredible paramount me i 40x 900 ha 35 x 900 oiii 35 x 900 sii
i am currently having an argument about the correct terminology on how to refer to the stars of other systems
my stance is that the word sun is a name for the star of our system and calling other stars suns is incorrect
my friend says on the other hand that calling other stars suns is correct
ampx200b which one is it
for a school paper that i am doing i need to observe andromeda along different places throughout its radius
center 10kly out from center 20kly out from center etc
i looked up that andromeda is 178 arcmins wide in the night sky meaning the radius of it is about 90 arcmins
i am using a telescope network called skynet to do these observations
my question is if i added 45 mins 90 arc min radius divided by 2 to give me halfway out from the center to the declination that is given for andromeda would that give me the coordinates for halfway out from the center of the galaxy or some random patch of sky that i do not care about
i have two images linked here one is the pregiven coordinates given to me by skynet and the other is the declination after i added about 45 minutes to it
 thanks for any help i am pretty new to this so i am probably asking some stupid questions
note i did some basic right angle trig with 25 million light years as one side and 075 degrees as the angle
45 arc mins 075 of an angle
it came out to 326 thousand light years from the core when it should be about 55kly have i done something wrong
fact 1 the universe began as a single point and is has since been expanding at the speed of light
fact 2 the light from distant stars must travel a great distance before reaching our eyes therefore when gazing into the night sky you are seeing light from deep space events that have already occurred ie
you are looking into the past
my question if the entire universe began at a single point and if things cannot move faster than the speed of light how are we able to see light from events that have already occurred
if we cannot move faster than the speed of light how are we so far ahead of these past events that it takes a significant amount of time for the light to reach our eyes
in other words how is the concept of space even possible if things all began at the same time big bang and we are limited by the speed of light
i want to be clear that i am not challenging the science just genuinely curious
i may also not even be asking the right questions but maybe someone will be able to interpret what i am trying to ask
thanks
here is the list of 2022 positions that are all now filled i am currently doing the southern new hampshire university online computer science program will this qualify me to possibly participate in these programs
what are they looking for in the application process
and is there anything i can do in the meantime volunteering at local observatory maybe
to help me be an impressive applicant
i have an older meade ds2130 reflector telescope with the autostar
i was out tonight trying to spot m57
specs 130mm aperature 1020mm focal length and i was using a 26mm eyepiece observing location quite light polluted unfortunately some street lights and tennis court lights near by and the bortle is 67 so not the best but it is what i have i got the telecope aligned well using the one star alignment i used vega
even after looking at other objects it was able to slew back to vega accurately so when i slewed to m57 i was reasonably certain i was in the right area
i guess i did not know what to look for
would it be apparent at the 40x mag i was using
or should i bump it up duing my initial search with a 15x barlow
i just saw a fireball meteor for the first time ever
i am still in shock
it was so bright green low and right in front of me
i almost thought we were getting bombed i am so grateful i just got to experience it
1020 minutes before i saw it i saw a shooting star and thought that was cool
this was amazing
i created a video detailing the difference between a luminance and ha shot
thought it might be useful to some people here

is there anywhere in space where you could draw a straight line from one edge of the universe to the other end without hitting any matter
i get that the shape size and openness pardon my layman term of descriptions of the universe is somewhat contested and evolving
but if i understand it correctly the universe is an infinite but closed system
this makes the universe a myriad of shapes but would it possibly be true that if you were to travel a certain speed faster than the speed of light in one direction then you would end up the in the same spot you started
just trying to wrap my head around how the universe is shaped which seems to require some creativity and abstract thought
 some annotated screenshots using stellarium there
trying to observe andromeda but with slightly altered radec coords so that it is not the center of the galaxy
however this proves to be difficult as with different times of day come different angles meaning i do not know what angle to use to do calculations on how much i change the radec coords
could anyone help
also is it better to make observations when m31 is at its highest elevation in the sky check imgur photo to see what i am referring to or is it okay as long as it is above the horizon to do whenever
if it is okay to do whenever the above problem is not so much of a problem as i would not have to know the angle that it will be at in the future
sorry for the beginner questions
i am interested in radio astronomy guys the time has come
but i am having trouble finding answers on the internet with a straightforward unadvertised answer
i have access to a large3m old style parabolic antenna that i want to customize for astronomical purposes the issue that i have though is that i can not find answers on how far i would be able to detect readable signals with that size dish compared to the equipment
i have researched on what wavelengths i should be on in my jobs doing athome cable jobs but that is not comparable to a signal like what i am looking for
i know i can upgrade to a more sensitive receiver but will it matter
should i switch to a different antenna
am i just wasting my time with something that should be left to the ones that can afford huge multimillion dollarmultistage equipment to feed me the answers i want
edit receiver meaning low noise amplifier
i have been up too long
so i have access to multiple small1m antennas and one large45ish m i have not measured the big one yet
but straight to the point i own a decent amount of property with 30 acres to call my own
would it be possible to build a very large array vla of radio telescopes on mine and my friends properties spread over about 4 miles without affecting local broadcasting stations
i can filter out excess noise i receive as i know what i am looking for so that is no issue
since running cable that length and strength would be too costly as of this moment i have thought about storing it all in closeproximity solid state drives
on top of all of this would the data be comparable with normal time standards or does it have to be compared using the atomic clock
i understand this is a lot to ask in one go but i am a knowitall so yk
in all seriousness qualified feedback is greatly appreciated
if i wanted to compile a complete list of all stars visible under the absolute best conditions maybe from earth orbit no atmosphere with a reasonable size binoculars which i figure would be lm 125 which catalogues should i reference
gaia seems to have bright stars missing which i did not expect
i am looking for the most accurate and up to date astrometry and physical properties
i live close to a huge parking space in london ontario canada and for some reason i woke up at 4 am yesterday saturday july 23
i looked out through the window and it was a clear sky
so i decided to go out and do some lunar planetary observation and imaging
yep i am a recreational astronomer who does stuff like this for fun and to contemplate on my own life
i parked my car in a random spot and did my thing for about an hour
just when i was about to pack my stuff and leave three homeless people approached me
they were not drunk or high so i was not worried
they asked if they can look through my telescope and i pointed my scope towards the moon it was a beautiful crescent and my scope dobs 8 is powerful enough to reveal craters and much more specific details
so they were surprised to look at the moon that close and started discussing with me about astronomy
one of them even knew about the james webb space telescope
after about 5 mins they asked me my name mohammed thanked me immensely and left me after sharing their view that a lot of people do not even talk to folks like them and i was kind enough to show them the moon
my mentor the previous day told us that old people just feel lonely sometimes and spending some quality time with them would be the best thing to do at times
he was talking about senior housing crisis but these people are no different than that too
i was glad that i could do the best i can by putting some smile in their faces that morning
i will always continue to include everyone in my journey of sharing my passion and i was lucky i had 3 guests that day
thanks for reading have a nice and cozy sunday if you would like to support and follow me in my journey here is my instagram 
as a lover of space and future astrophysics major i was thinking of traveling to cherry springs state park in pennsylvania supposedly one of the best places to view the night sky
it is about 35 hours away from me so i want to make sure that i plan accordingly
the best weekend for me to go schedulewise is august 67 on august 6 the moon is going to be in its waxing gibbous phase which i know is not great for viewing the night sky
i checked moonrise and moon set times and it says that the moon is going to set at 105 am on august 6 which is the night i would be viewing the stars
does this mean that the moon will be out of view in the sky meaning that it will not hurt the visibility of the stars
i really want to make my trip worth it and would rather not travel such a distance to barely see much so i would love some advice
got interested on how plants and other things such as fungi could evolve on other planets along with how plant life may flourish depending on the position of the planet to the sun moon etc
i am looking for any article talking about this or something similar
this is a serious question i have for all the astronomers and astrophysicists
i need it for my project
i need to know realistic odds of it happening
i tried google and quora but could not really find exactly what i was looking for
let us say hypothetically an earthkiller sized asteroid circa 10km in diameter were to enter our solar system on a collision course with earth
i know that it will sound crazy but please stay with me
also let us assume that this asteroids movement is not purely natural but it has a device inside let us say gravitational engine that can alter the asteroids course slightly within physics constraints from the moment it enters our ss until it hits earth
would it be possible for it to hit earth or at least get very close let us say distance of the moon
without being detected with our current technology and space monitoring
let us also assume that from the outside it is just a piece of rock
no special emissions of any sorts unnatural for a typical asteroid
if the alien thing is way to scifi for you to answer simply go with a completely natural rock on a collision course with earth
as the title explains i am looking for a website that easily displays our solar system at specific datestimes
i have tried to find a site via google but have not been successful yet
i have tried all the google and youtube searches i can think of for this so that is why i am here taking a shot in the dark
i am all out of ideas guys honestly
the documentary was a computer animation tour of the solar system probably less than half an hour
the various segments were tied together by artwork of a line being drawn on an oldlooking map aged brown paper and beautiful illustrations from the inner solar system to the outer solar system
when it got to the outer edge of the solar system i remember seeing the same comet animation that was used in the intro for star trek deep space nine so what i am describing could not be older than 1993 the music was relaxing and the male narrators voice was soothingi think he may have been ricardo montalbn the actor who originally played khan from star trek but i am not sure
it is possible that what i am remembering may have been produced for a museum rather than tv but i saw it on a tape that my dads friend made for him a compilation of various bits of computer animation
hey folks just wanted to bring to everyone is attention the fact that it is a reasonably good time to do some meteor observing at the moment it is pretty much new moon yay
dark skies
 and being the southern hemisphere winter we get some long dark nights so that is all cool anyway
at the moment we have got three halfdecent meteor showers active
one the delta aquariids is one of the better showers of the year for southern hemisphere observers though not a match for mays eta aquariids or decembers geminids
at its peak this coming weekend it has a forecast zhr of 25 for those who are not familiar with it the zhr of a meteor shower is the zenithal hourly rate it is an estimate of the number of meteors you would see in an hour under absolutely perfect conditions
so in reality you will see fewer meteors than the zhr
meteors in a given meteor shower appear to radiate from a certain point in the night sky the radiant of the shower
the higher the radiant is in the sky the more meteors you will see from that shower
if the radiant is below the horizon you will not see anything from the shower as the meteors will all be hitting the far side of the earth
so for the delta aquariids the radiant is near the star delta aquarii
when that star is low in the sky the rates you see from the shower will be lower and the higher the star gets the better the rates you see will be
on saturday night skat delta aquarii will culminate be at its highest at around 215am which means that is when you can expect to see peak rates from the meteor shower
make sense
the delta aquariids are the main event
skat rises in the relatively early evening at the moment meaning that shower meteors are visible all night but decent rates will only be seen once it has climbed a bit in the sky
if you want to check when it rises where you are go to stellarium the web version is great but i do not know if i can link it here
 search for skat and then lock it in and move time forwards and backwards
ampx200b on top of the delta aquariids there are two other more minor showers that peak around the same time
the alpha capricornids are great although they are a weak shower zhr around 5 at peak they have a reputation for producing lots of bright meteors and even fireballs
where delta aquariid meteors are mediumfast the alpha capricornids are markedly slower which makes them a good target for astrophotographers though the low rates can be frustrating
then we have the piscis austrinids another minor shower with peak zhrs of around 5 meteors from this shower are faster than alpha capricornids but slower than delta aquariids ampx200b the radiants of the three showers are relatively close to each other in the sky meaning that all are high in the sky for those of us in the southern hemisphere for the hours around midnight and into the early morning
ampx200b what does all this mean
well this weekend is a good time to get out somewhere dark rug up nice and warm and lay out under the stars for a few hours take a friend and a warm drink and lie back and relax i am not promising a meteor storm or anything like that but the rates can be quite impressive when added together
a couple of years back at an astro meet up here in queensland i counted 50 meteors in three hours from the three showers combined so a pretty nice treat in the middle of winter ampx200b as for where to look a good tip to maximise the number of meteors you see is to work out where the radiants of the showers are and to look about 45 degrees above the horizon about thirty to 45 degrees left or right of that point wherever the sky is darkest
that is a good way of maximising the number of meteors you will see by maximising the amount of the earths atmosphere you are looking for without looking so low in the sky that you are looking through loads of gunk and grot in the sky
ampx200b this meteor shower calendar on spaceaustralias website has some good finder chats if you are interested in going out looking it is obviously got an australiacentric theme but the charts should help wherever you are enjoy
i am looking for a simple to use converter from ana f0 to fits anyone know of anything that will work
i cannot be the only one that would be interested in seeing a large impact against mars followed by venus or mercury
edit whenever i google variations of this i only get returns on spacecraft incidents involving one of mars moons
edit 2 bonus question how big of an impact could generate debris that could put the earth in danger
i have only heard of small pieces of mars or venus ending up on earth
i was stargazing tonight with my family and i noticed a bright object as bright as the international space station but it was moving super fast maybe 3 times faster than the iss
and it was not the iss because we had seen it just a few minutes before and it was going far slower like an leo sattlite which we saw many of tonight
in all my time star gazing i have never seen anything like this
i am wondering if there is a new bright satellite that i do not know about that matches my description or something else i am not sure
i live around the 45th latitude of the usa i will not specify where beyond that
the object was moving east
i have a question that has been bothering me for about a day now and i am having trouble finding an answers that are consistent
i am not an expert on astronomy so it is not something i just know or can figure out and i am to curious to give up on getting an answer
context first i was just sitting around as you do and the thought of looking down upon the milky way as an outside observer from maybe i do not know let us assume 500000 light years or so came into mind
i began wondering what it would look like to a human eye
the first thought was of course of a beautiful combination of colors and stars that are very visible like the exposure images we commonly see of other galaxies
however i eventually thought that maybe that is not how it would look to us at all
i mean we from earth with the naked eye can only see individual stars systems that are 17000 light years away without any equipment right
so would that be the same from intergalactic space from a distance significantly larger than 17000 light years or would the accumulated brightness of all 200 billion or so stars be enough to create the visual we imagine when we think galaxy
i mean the andromeda galaxy is just a dim smudge in the night sky but it is also 15x farther away that the distance we are using in our outside observer example
ampx200b so my question to the astronomers or reddit is from the outside would the milky way be bright enough to be viewed in a way similar to that of the artist renditions and the other galaxies in images or would to appear like the andromeda galaxy does to us from earth
somewhere inbetween

i just happened to be in my basement when i noticed this ray of light from the sun
the pictures are decent but in person it was really impressive
it is probably something that happens frequently and is overlooked
it did not last long
considering how many millions of years these photos had to bounce around inside the sun traverse outer space the earths atmosphere then into my basement gave me pause at the wonder of it all
so iss has a constant live feed from a camera pointed at earth giving us a nice top down view of the planet
and for a while i had that live stream projected as a background for my desktop with a map showing the position of the iss on the other screen
of course often there is no signal half the time it is completely black because night and ocean and even when there is day it is often accompanied by thick clouds
but when it worked well it was nice
but anyway that is not the point
are there any other cameras that give live feed 247 that are showing space with or without earth
with maybe the sun and the moon visible on occasion but mainly with the stars moving as the station orbits
is it even possible for such camera to capture stars or would the exposure not be enough
i am a senior in high school our school let us us take an independent study class where we plan our own curriculum
i want to go to college for physics and maybe do research in computational physics so i am making my study computational astrophysics
i am planning the curriculum right now and looking for textbooksresources that provide coding exercises
i am also looking for some project ideas
i am well versed in single and multivariable calculus vector calculus linear algebra and some of odes
thanks
took this photo about 2 years ago now and always wondered what the orange line on the right is
could ot be a shooting star
a star starts off as a collection of floating matter and then it coalesces and fusion begins
but how
after the very first instance of fusion starts up does the heat reduce that dense pocket and push some of the prestar outwards causing it to sputter on and off for millions of years
if so does this happen at multiple locations or just the center of mass
or does the reaction cascade out whereupon the star keeps going for the rest of its life
if that is the case what are some typical speeds for the propagation
after the very first instance of fusion how long very roughly does the whole star take to ignite to most of its primary brightness
or if that is too nebulous what about our sun
tldr do stars sputter to life or burst into it with a single spark
edit yes i tried google
national observatory is kind of stretching the facts
something i have always wondered
if there was another planet on our exact orbit for the sake of argument let us say it is of equal sizemass on the exact opposite of the sun would we be able to detect it
if so how
so i have a 6 newt on a dobsonian mount
i recently bought a digital camera for it and have gotten some nice pictures of the planets with it so far
i do however find it hard to get close up pictures because of course it is a dob and has no tracking
i also want to get into some brighter dsos but of course cannot do that because again no tracking
should i maybe just get a different scope for this kind of stuff maybe one one an equatorial mount and use the dob for viewing only
i would like to use the scope i have now because i really like it and i am not sure i will have the money to buy a new scope with a quality mount any suggestions
sorry the images are so grainy but hopefully it is enough to identify it
it was taken from glasgow scotland at around 0240 while i was observing jupiter
i am pretty sure it was moving at the same pace as everything else in the sky except jupiter and other planets 
as you can see it is very dim and i could not see it without looking through my telescope
if you need anymore information i am happy to answer questions
i am just getting back into astro photography after using film back in the 80s
i have all the equipment to still do film but i am curious as to this forums recommendations for using digital cameras like tablets and cell phones
i know planetary and lunar pictures can be taken with those but am specifically wondering about comparisons regarding the effectiveness of film vs new digital technology
possibly going to spruce knob in a few weeks
does anyone know of a few good places to observe the sky
i will probably be taking my 12 dob
can not believe a smart phone on a 20 second timer and phone edit software can produce such an image this would have blown my mind in the early 2000s if you told me a phone would be capable of such a thing
simple mind here but a black hole enthusiast
was wondering if you could explain to me the gravitational differences before and after a sun implodes into a black hole
does a star like uy skuti also have an event horizon and how does that change if at all after implosion
hope this is interesting enough a question to get some responses
thanks
anyone knows why the sunset is so weird
this line in the sky is 100 natural but i cannot explain why
my little girl is 16 and she has a passion for space stars and the vast universe
she actually has the same passion i had at her age
she would like to study in that field and then find a job
what job would studying in astronomy allow her to get
beside the obvious person behind a telescope which is a bit clich of the profession i have no idea what those jobs could be
thanks all for your help
i am working on a video game that takes place in space
so i am trying to recreate the stellar neighborhood out to at least 200 or so stars
so i need to know distances from the sun to a star but i also need to know how to calculate distances from a star to another star as well
so i need an accurate as possible 3 dimensional star map to work from
does anyone know a good resource that i can use for this
that would be cool to know that at any moment there will be a star blowing up somewhere
or is it an uncommon event
what about in the entire universe there will be a planet being battered to pieces by a meteor storm at any given moment
what discoveries in astronomy have excited you lately
or even what got you in this in the first place
i am posting on behalf of rhobbies we are trying to better understand what inspires people to get into a hobby and remain excited about it
if you are interested in what we are building you can check out the current spreadsheet pinned there
if your recommendation contains some sort of resource reference video images links social media account site etc linking that in your post is appreciated
you have probably seen a similar post on a few other subreddits
i am sure it is annoying and i promise these will end soon
it is just hard to know where to start building a knowledge base without the guidance of the community that knows it best
any and all feedback is appreciated 
having a hard time finding a good easy to use app that helps identify satellites
any recommendations
such distant beauty
do you belong to yours
i do and am currently really enjoying the monthly meeting which thanks covid we can always join via zoom
tonights main talk is on scorpius
it is fascinating
i have been having trouble thinking on how to word this post so let me start by saying since i was a kid astronomy has been my passion
how many of us did not dream on being an astronaut when they were little
well i did for sure
like most of us space has always been a central theme on my life from games toys tshirts starprojectors and who can forget those little glowinthedark stars you glued to your ceiling
because of the world we live in we probably were discouraged on our profession and chose something more down to earth since we felt astronomy may not be the way to go carreermoneywise
i chose engineering
i am 27 about to turn 28 and i have been feeling this void inside for a while telling me that what i am doing is not what i should be doing or that i could have more joy in my life
this feeling grew even more when the first pictures from jwst got released and i could not help but cry when i saw them
seeing the beauty of the vastness of space lit up that spark inside of me once again
i want to get back on track
we are about 25m people in this community and some of the people here luckily got the chance to make a living out of this passion
i want that
if any of you reading this are i would like to be involved in any way possible just to have this sense of purpose back in my life
be it that you need some kind of assistant to crunch numbers or another pair of eyes and ears to have input on an idea or discovery
not looking for a job per se but just by being part of the field or being surrounded by people that enjoy this the same as i do at least gives me a chance to some day work doing what i love looking at space
hey all i have been considering astromodifying my nikon d5600 dslr but i am worried it would not be worth it as i enjoy taking daytime pictures too
does anyone have opinions or pictures of how astromodified dslrs work in the daytime
thanks
hello all
i am a terminologist working mostly in scientific domains and lately i have been quite interested in astronomy
as i looked up information on the kuiper belt i came across the kbos and tnos and it seemed to me that sources were kind of divided over whether or not they are the same thing
it felt to me that kbos are not quite the same but my knowledge is not sufficient to be 100 sure
can anyone help
very appreciated
i am guessing if a planet orbits too slowly it will just fall into its parent starplanet
i am curious how slow a planet or moon could orbit
not sure if this is too general but i was wondering if people had any interesting chemistry questionsdebated topics when it comes to just chemistry in astronomy like formation of elements in stellar cores spectral lines objects that may act like blackbodies etc
ie
do you know of any potentially interesting chemistryrelated questions in the context of astronomy

obviously the farther you travel into those clouds the heavier the clouds would get until it would crush anything
even the clouds on venus are extremely heavy and is the equivalent of being six miles underwater

i was little afraid when i saw this and i want to ask if it is possible that the moon to be destroyed 
or is it part of the virgo supercluster or someother
about a year ago i went into semi retirement and moved back to germany
one of my first projects was to build a permanent setup in my back yard
size 25m across and 35 m tall ampx200b yesterday i did my first test
there are still a few gremlins in the system but overall i am happy with the first result imaging scope saxon 200pds on a sw eq6r pro zwo asi1600 camera gso coma corrector zwo filter wheel and focuser guiding sw 80st scope with zwo asi120mc camera 20 x 30sec l and 20 x 90sec rg and b each stacked with dss and process using photoshop
looking forward to more northern sky objects in the coming months
clear skies
i know that interstellar travel is extremely challenging due to the immense amount of energy needed to move fast enough to make i stellar travel reasonable plus i have no idea how we would create a spacecraft that would not be vaporizer traveling over light speed
however say it was possible how much of an obstacle would the 1000 light years of distance from one side of the local bubble to the other be
edit i am a novice enthusiast i forgot about crumpled space and that no object could travel faster than light
here is a dumb question from an astronoob
i know basically nothing about astronomy but would love to learn
i have a 10 dobsonian that can deliver great images and is a real pleasure to look through
i am slowly learning all my key stars and how to find classic dsos visually primarily using turn left at orion as my guide
i live in a rural area which is reasonably dark but not exceptional
here is my problem
i can easily find my anchor stars with the naked eye
but when looking through the finderscope a rightangle scope with an erect image there are so many more stars visible that it is very difficult for me to figure out if i am looking at the same area i spotted visually
if my anchor star is extremely bright sometimes i will be able to spot it in the scope but otherwise it feels like a crapshoot
consequently there are many objects whose locations i could point to visually but just struggle to aim the telescope at
is this a common problem
i could imagine attaching a green laser to the scope to make this easy but there is got to be another way right
thanks
a hubble image with great dimensionality

is it true please 
should this worry us and will it affect our lives
i was wondering if this information was also true
sorry if this is not allowed
feel free to remove it
just thought it was an awesome screenshot
i enjoy this game because of its astronomy related aspects
so figured some people here may enjoy it also

if homo sapiens set foot on mars as an example planet in our solar system do we not then become an interplanetary emphasis on inter species
or did that already happen when we sent an unmanned lander to mars like the viking expedition in the 70s
in the same vein if you land a vehicle or would it again require people
on proxima b a planet around proxima centauri i would think that one of those would make us intraplanetary a new word
or is that just intergalactic
or both
and then is going to any body in the andromeda galaxy as an example what would make us intragalactic
editin writing out this question intraplantery and intragalactic are coming up as not words so maybe i know even less than i thought
that is one and thanks also i have not found an adjective to describe our landing on the moon in this way is there a word
intersalletial
interlunar seems to confined to just terra and luna
that could be used to describe our species after such an event
thanks
thanks in advance i really did think that intragalactic and intraplanetary were words
i have to fight my phone just to get them to be written down
i have only found a few examples of data that someone else has posted for public use
i am practicing my processingstacking of images before my setup arrives and am trying to find publicfree sources of raw format zip files
i have found a few of some nebulae and the andromeda galaxy but i am hungry for more until i am able to capture my own photos
hey i took some photos of the night sky and wondered if anybody could help me figure out the constellations the pics are taken by an iphone hope it is clear enough
so for my whole life i visited crescroatia and there are always waves at around 6pm 5 minute difference at most the waves are actually quite large and noticeable and it is not from ships because they do not pass by at those times i realised this happened at different places at different times eg
zadar croatia the waves come in at around 530 pm
i figured this has something to do with the moon but i cannot find anything on it so if anyone can help or provide more info that would be amazing
if the milky way is rotating around it are we technically in its orbit
sorry i know nothing about astronomy or even if this is the right sub
so i am going to be up north in michigans upper peninsula during the peak for the perseids this year
i was stoked to hear this but then i also heard the moon will be full and was kind of bummed i will not see as many shooting stars
i live near detroit and even though i love the nightsky i rarely ever see much because of the light pollution
will i still see a lot more stars and things even though it is a full moon
i would imagine so but some people online say a full moon makes it even worse than city light pollution
so i guess in conclusion my question is is light pollution from the moon in a totally dark bortle zone 1 worse than light pollution from living in a big city
first off let me clarify what i mean by strange i do not know what it is or what it could be
i do not have the equipment to record it
i have referred to the chart from rule 3 and it is not a chinese lantern
it is very far away
its as tiny and bright as any other star on the sky
it will stay completely stationary then move very fast in either direction then go on to be completely stationary again
this does not happen in any regular intervals just every now and then
i am assuming it is very far away and therefore really fast
any idea what that could be
i have been just looking at it in awe for a couple of minutes
if its a manmade satellite how much fuel does it have
i do not doubt we have the technology but it is very fast and precise
dear all my question may sound funny but am intrigued since a few weeksmonths now with an observation
maybe it is a basic question for rest hence request to share logical reasoning observation i have been waking up to a beautiful sunrise from my balcony everyday since 4 years now each day i perform yoga looking at the beautiful picturesque view and always noticed sun to be always in the middle of my balcony almost the same time everyday
consider a horizontal line being my balcony and if we form a vertical line at 90 angle in exact between and that is where sun always has been
 i am myself laughing writing this d recently since last few monthsweek i have noticed the sun axis or it is rising almost 120 or more angle towards left meaning over recent months possible year sunrise is happening or more visible towards the left side of my balcony
i seriously hope this is making sense because frankly even am laughing but i am intrigued
not a scientist etc
but am sure daily things too make us wonder what is happening and this question has been with me since months now hence thought of reaching out i hope someone has explanation to this or any thoughts if not at least i hope you too laughed on my curious funny mind d attached is old pic 2020 i think and you can see sunrise here sunrise 2020 ampx200b
hello everyone
ok so i am going into my junior year of my undergraduate study of astrophysics with a minor in mathematics and i was thinking about getting an internship or at least signing up for some
i was wondering what are some good places to sign up
i have always wanted to intern at nasa but i am not too experienced in programming yet and i feel like a lot of their stuff deals with programming correct me if i am wrong maybe i have to get a little further down my path to get an internship since i do not have much experience in programming i know programming is a big part of astrophysics if anyone has suggestions it would really help
astronomy
hello everyone
i hope this post does not break any rules
i have developed a keen interest in astronomy but my knowledge is still very rudimentary
it would be brilliant to learn much more on the job but i am a very experienced software engineer and not a physicist so i wonder if changing software sectors would be a challenge
of course software would be quite important for astronomy as it is for anything else
in numerous searches i have only found a small handful of companies that are advertising
none of them are remote and the vast majority need us citizenship or residency i am not looking to relocate
can anyone recommend any companies or organisations that are hiring for remote roles in astronomy or similar
alternatively can you recommend any prominent open source projects i can look into
thanks
ok so i used to be an amateur astronomer stopped because of lack of time and a professional astronomer but i am a bit out of ideas about what i just saw
yes i read the rules and the flow chart does not have an option for bright as a star intermittent and seemingly stationary
it was close to aachen germany about 0100 local time
whatever that was was at about 21h55m 4720
it was about as bright as a plane at cruising altitude
i was lying there hunting for meteors for an hour so
it blinked two or three times with maybe half a second between the pulsee
then it was dark for one or two seconds and then had a last blink
and then it was gone
it all lasted for about 5 secods and did not seem to move during that time
so i can exclude a star planet iss plane 1 meteor satellite 2
i also do not think it was an iridium flare they tend to move fast enough to perceive their change in location
1 except for maybe very high altitude military drones
but then why would they blink four times and then go dark again 2 geostationary satellite that sometimes happen to reflect a lot of light
but i cannot imagine that a satellite at 35000 km can be seen with a naked eye
and no i was not sleeping and i am not drunk or high so yeah
i have no idea what it was suggestions
during my morning walk today i captured some video and pictures of a local lake and the fog passing over
i have lots of moon and fog pics but i am almost certain this is the sun
i used a few apps to confirm and they all listed this was the sun
my confusion is that the shape appears defined without the rays
i am looking for experienced star gazere to help me understand what i am seeing

hi i am sorry if it is not relevant to this sub but i need help in gdl
i am a pure beginner in it and i have been following some forums and guides
i seem to have known how the very basic codes and stuff work since i already know python a lot but i cannot seem to get how to get startup file how to call pro files and read them and plot them how to call idl codes and read them there is no proper documentation or guide for it
please help me finding some great resources to learn gdl gnu data language
plus it is so freaking weird that gdl is such a less talked about program of course it is used by astronomers and all but still i used it for few hours and made some surface graphs and i was blown away another question can those be done in python as well
anyway looking forward to any guidance
would the night sky be bright from the stars in the center of the galaxy
would it be brighter during the day
hi me and my friends were planning on watching the perseid shower peak somewhere outside the city pollution around bortle 3 but apparently there is going to be a full moon that night which is bortle 78
where i live the highest altitude is going to be only 20 degrees
i know moonlight pollution depends on a bunch of things but how to consider altitude here
the discovery of fiction came from studying matter interactions
broadly a body remains at rest or in motion until an exerted force in an equal but opposite direction
a look into the nature of the materials on contact and their surface coatings demonstrates no direct contact takes place
atoms are frequently aligned to fit the center of a momentum frame about the center a quantity that is invariant
at scale the extent of the surface area with respect to the time that surfaces remain in contact leads to kinetic friction
for example the first major invention the wheel
invented sometime around 4200 4000 because applied the laws of physics
the idea revolves around a centered turning motion resulting in a torque force some radial distance at the point of contact with the surface
if static atomically the atoms align and a normal force is present
a torque force and a static force are present if an object begins to move
a torque force and no motion is only present if no surface to surface contact or burn out called kinetic friction
in motion the objects momentum frame shifts in the direction of travel
assuming the objects mass shifts due to torque then the static force weakens as the vertical momentum frame has decreased
in vehicles suspension adjusts and the momentum frame shifts back during acceleration
assuming a lightweight object with just enough mass for static contact
then it accelerates and the object will levitate from the surface periodically
a skippinglike motion
in this scenario external mass will have to be added to adjust the momentum frame for continuous surface contact
in relation the speed of light is said to be static
no acceleration or deceleration
instead light bends and stretches as it travels at a constant speed of 299792458 meters per second
this characteristic could possibly be described as a skippinglike motion
interaction in matter surface interactions and photon energy interactions
a matter of entropy and there will be natural logs
back in the early 90s i bought a really large galactic map from an advertisement in astronomy magazine
i hung it on my bedroom wall and it took up most of it probably about 8 feet 24m by 4 feet 12m
it had an overall black background with blue and white text and the vast majority of the stars were labeled and the dots were scaled to represent magnitude
several other celestial objects like the magellanic clouds and a few galaxies were also included
the shape of the map within the rectangular poster was of the night sky in one giant ellipse with the galactic center at the center of the map galactic north was up etc
it looked a bit like this but with a ton of labels possible only because of the maps large size
it also did not really need highlighting of the central plane since there were enough dots to show it naturally
what i liked about it was the edgeoncrosssection look instead of the artificial perspective of viewing the galaxy from a point far above the galactic plane
i have searched and searched and cannot find it and do not know that i could print something so big on my own
maybe there are specialty map publishers that could recreate it or maybe someone else had a copy of the map and remembers the publisher
most of the maps i find today are more on the artistic side than the accurate side
any suggestions for something remotely similar
it was specifically designed to observe the draco constellation
photo taken 10 august 2022
forgive me if this is a stupid question i know next to nothing about astronomy
at about 0510 central time i saw a steady streak of light while looking eastsoutheast from river falls wi
light was observed for about 3060 seconds and moved steadily towards horizon
have not ever seen anything like that before curious as to what it might have been
picture attached i also have a video but it is extremely potato quality
so yesterday i pointed my telescope out towards the direction of the moon and these group of stars showed up
i cannot really tell if i am looking at a nebula or a star cluster but all i know is that i found this in the sagittarius constellation
woke up at 420 this morning thanks age
to this electric blue display
venus is rising just below the clouds
hi all so i have been doing astronomy for about 7 months now
i have a 6 dobsonian telescope and a celestron inspire 70az which i am currently in the process of selling
i intend on in the next 4 months buying some nice gear for dedicated astrophotography
i already own a dslr camera and i intend on buying a skywatcher evostar 72ed ds pro and a skywatcher eq32 mount for it
since i do not have those yet and have no tring adapter for my dslr i was wondering if it would be possible for me to shoot a series of 10s exposures using my nikon d7000 with a vivitar series 1 28mm105mm zoom lens with a minimum f of f28
i live in a fairly light polluted suburban area and am not particularly bothered about detail like dust lanes just yet and was purely wondering if its bright core and maybe the core of one of its satellites could be visible with my current setup
would this work
so i have been in astronomy since the start of summer i bought a telescope to look at planets and have really enjoyed it
i moved back to home nebraska and started looking r for a club that needs near by
turns out there is one literally across the street i never knew about
updates to come
can you help explain a discrepancy in the following finding
 i am creating a new tool to examine periodicities in time series
when applying the tool to water levels across 8 separated locations within the usa i have found periodicities of 175004 yrs 179522 yrs190007 yrs and 220315 yrs
the most significant is 1750004 yrs
i have found papers describing an 1861 nodal tidal cycle but this does not match either of the four major periodicities in that time scale
the attached plot shows 3 of 4 periodicities picked up when looking at santa monica water levels date range jan 1983 jun 2022 datum mean high water sampling hourly url edited 20220812 1019 am the visually dominant peak in 5 of 10 locations is at exactly 153444 hrs 175004 yrs
santa monica plot 10 location plot edited 20220812 1152 am please accept the methodology as a black box
i would like to know which physical factors may have lead to the stated periodicities
i have been trying to take a simple ap photo for a while now and starting on the moon seems ideal its closer easy to see and can help you learn you camera after months of trying and getting blurry badly exposed or noisy images i finally managed to take this bad boy this morning
 full moon taken 12082022 jim crawford 2022 what i found amazing is that in post processing i inverted the image and rotated it and was blown away by what i could see inverted full moon taken 12082022 jim crawford 2022
 nothappenauid2215auid2020 nothappenauid2215auid2020 i have attempted to do as much of my own research on this one as possible
i searched through the few academic databases i am able to access but i was unable to find the papers referenced in the article
i am very much an amateur on this subject matter so i thought i would post it here and i am by no means attempting to start a heated debate or argument
i am simply wondering if someone with a far greater understanding of the physics of space can say whether or not this hypothesis holds any water
to me lerners arguments seem vague at best but i could very much be wrong
i know he wrote a book on the issue back in 1991 so it seems like he would be biased
but i am just curious are we in the middle of a paradigm shift because of the jwt images as far as the big bang is concerned
or is lerner more of an outsider just trying to promote his own work
thanks for any and all responses in advance
in this paper it is stated that the optimal size of the arms turns out to be onefourth of the wavelength
but there is no further explanation has anyone an idea why this is the case
hello fellow astronomers
i have been working for the past year on a python code designed to help people who are using ensemble photometry
it is called the variable and reference stars locator varsl it will help the user find steady reference stars for parts of the sky that aavso does not have in their variable star plotter
i have the link to the github page below for anyone to freely download and use
this code is intended to make the process of finding reference stars quicker and increase certainty of accuracy when using ensemble photometry for data analysis
this can be used to help with exoplanet research variable star research and any other research that relies on the use of ensemble photometry
i am hoping some of you will be able to find this helpful

can someone please guide me or provide me resources or anything on how i translate idl scripts to python
i got this amazing opportunity but to get in i have been given this task to convert an idl script to python
the task the prof first gave me was super hard so i asked him and he gave easier one then again an easier one
i have been working on the script for over a week now
i tried gdl and stuff but now nothing seems to worki just need to understand the idl script but i do not know how to
it is all going over my head and i need to use appropriate libraries in python to run those but i do not know which one to
i cannot ask him since it feels really weird now considering that he broke down the task very much and it is already been a week
not asking for direct help but just some advice on what to do with the idl script
any adviceguidance would mean a lot
 by the way the idl script is related to some astronomical satellite imaging
i need to extract pngps file out of the pythontranslatedidl file
to all the astrophysicists here do you use idl
have you ever
if yes why
and how did you convert it into python script
how can i
as the question suggests how a science group leasing time on these telescopes decides what patch of sky or space they wish to focus the telescopes for their allotted time slot
how they know in prior to find something interesting in seemingly empty region
or is it just random hoping to find something interesting
the question came to my mind looking at a previous post about related to zoomingin on cartwheel galaxy
first few seconds the region looks apparently empty no one would have expected to see a galaxy collision but then they find such a peculiar occurrence i understand the notion of galactic timescale but one still needs to know where to look and more importantly how long to look
are there studies where a group found nothing interesting in their allotted time slot or maybe they did not collected signals for just right amount of time running out of their assigned time slot
hey all
a few years ago i got a celestron 4 inch mak on the cheap goto mount
more recently i picked up a used cpc 800 gps for a great deal
to this day in 1520 attempts between both scopes i have gotten sky align to work once
i thought with the gps on the new it would really make things easier but tonight trying it for the first time it outright failed on 3 attempts and the one that worked immediately slewed to the wrong side of the sky for saturn
the problem is clearly with me but i am at a loss as to what i am doing wrong
i have watched the youtube videos etc
i try to pick lower horizon targets across a wide area of sky when visibility permits
trying to manually track with the hand controller at these focal lengths is sucking the joy out of it much less trying to change out an eye piece or really experiment with different barloweyepiecefilter combos
i just came in from finally getting saturn in my 10 dob and 5mm celestron xcel ep 240x mag australian skies
perfect tonight so good so freaking happy had the ep awhile now first time getting the ep to work do not think i was collimated good enough my first try
could make out the separation in the rings and a single cloud band or ring shadow
on the planet
so freaking cool
got in quite a few globulars at zenith too before the moon rise bloody great views in a short amount of time tonight
got my starsense explorer mirror mounted from my old telescope finally and was swinging that scope all over zenith snatching targets so much fun
star hopping has been a long and tedious exercise although i have gotten good
but the starsense app has made life so much easier
m54557022 a few others couple nebs and a galaxy fkn loving it
how do you my partner is wanting to challenge their high school students with some extra credit by having them make a starwheel but from the perspective of another galaxy
so then they would have all new constellations or the same constellations but from another perspective
what program could be used to help design such a thing
they are only bogged down by picking a location and then knowing their students can actually pull it off without way too much work
it is supposed to be fun not painful
i have been playing around with libnova and recently stumbled across libastro but have not been able to find an official web page for it or anybody who knows anything about it
as the title say would it be possible given i have good telescope let us say one for 10001500tracking tripod and an usbspectrometer
i would like to analyse stars composition velocity rotation etc from the spectrum i gather using instruments aboveis it possible or would you say that the atmosphere light pollution an cheap instruments will limit my possibilities
i have masters in material sciences and always wanted to get into practical astronomy but just making long exposure pictures is not so interesting to me
i want to get deep into physics and obtains some interesting results
any help is appreciated
i was out driving with my sister when we saw a large orange star in the sky
we were nearly home and so once parked we embarked to the fields about 5 minutes away to get away from the light pollution only to find the star was gone
wondered what it was
some things below to note in england and was approximately in the north on saturday evening at approximately 1130pm was about 2 thirds high in the sky was about 3 times as big as a star and was a dusky orange in the black night sky was completely stationary between first losing sight of the star and finding that it was no longer in the location we saw it was about 10 minutes can give more details if needed any help appreciated d edit we do live under the landing path for a major airport however due to this i can usually distinguish quite easilly if an object is a plane or not
my sister also used an app to spot overhead planes nearby and nothing was in that area
we had parked and were stationary when we used a star map app
the approach was also completely wrong unless the plane was on a crash course
i often see photos of planets moon and nebula in this sub taken by amateur astronomers using portable telescopes you can buy online
however many of those images have to be processed after long exposures to make details visible
i am curious if instead of cameras i looked through one of those telescopes using my eyes what kind of objects would i able to see with reasonable details
say is it possible to see jupiter and its bands or saturns rings with such telescopes
hi all i am trying to figure something out for fantasy project
i have tried looking through some wikipedia pages and general google searches but seem to be coming up short
i want to know what main part of the moon gets the most sun
we on earth have an area around the equator that gets relatively warmer climates
23degree north and south
that 23 degrees is due to the earths obliquity tilt as it rotates on it is axis
as far as i can find out the moons obliquity is 668 degrees
i have also learnt that the moon is at 514 degree incline from our orbitalecliptic plane with the sun
how does that incline affect the area to receive to focus of solar radiation
dear astronomers
i have been searching and searching but did not get a clear answer yet
the question is the following what is the origin of the solar nebula
so far i understand this the solar nebula was a large nebula made out of gasses and matter including h and he but also c fe o etc presumably a shockwave from a nearby supernova led to the collapse of this nebula initiating the work of gravity to eventually lead to an accretion disc
so my theory so far is the following the solar nebula itself is made out of the remnants of supernovas from red giants that were formed in the early universe
the remnants happen to merge eventually into a big nebula
this would explain why the nebula contained traces of atoms other than h and he
so how far off am i
many thanks in advance
kind greetings
hi everyone
we are trying to get adapters for our rig as soon as possible
connecting an innovations foresight onag xm to 1 thorlabs lens tube sm2 reverse gendered
2 tpo 12 inch rc rear cell and 3 zwo asi6200 series camera
i have tried talking to custom machine shops like precise parts but their ship date is not until sept 3 and we need these parts as soon as possible
any suggestions as to where to look or if anyone has any adapters that would work lying around we are willing to pay
thank you
hypothetically could you have a rocky planet with an atmosphere where a star gazer looks up and sees a black hole without aid of a telescope
also without the planet being drawn in to its doom in next few million years ex
could you look at the night sky and go oh look it is that black star that obscures everything behind it or there is that tiny donutshaped star on the horizon which is a actually tidal disruption event
i just thought about it because i was reading this piece of literature wikipedia about the new horizons mission images taken by the lorri camera while new horizons was 42 to 45 au from the sun were used to measure the cosmic optical background the visible light analog of the cosmic microwave background in seven high galactic latitude fields
at that distance new horizons saw a sky ten times darker than the sky seen by the hubble space telescope because of the absence of diffuse background sky brightness from the zodiacal light in the inner solarsystem
these measurements indicate that the total amount of light emitted by all galaxies at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths may be lower than previously thought
so my main question is this now that we have the jwst working and the technique to put in a specific spot of space such delicate instruments is it imaginable that in the next couple of decades it will be doable to put an even enhanced version of the jwst in the outer solar system
i imagine data transfer would be an issue for which we would need some sort of permanent stations on for example jupiter to receive and replicate information from so afar
i imagine those stations could also work studying jupiters atmosphere for example
it is just fantasy but i wanted to know if it is a reasonable maybe longterm idea
the jupiter and pluto images are so amazing
i cannot sleep thinking that there is stuff made by us at 50 au bringing information about a lot of unknown stuff that we know exists but little we know about although it is in our cosmic backyard
there is so so much to explore even in our home system that i want to cry
i know that this is a long shot but i was wondering if anyone had this issue lying around
i am looking for the article by kenneth rose on pinhole mirrors
i like how you can actually hear it on the video 
anyone on ohios north coast want to provide updates
i am 15 minutes away from lake erie
i am halfway tempted to drive up and keep an eye out but i do not know if it would be worth it
it could be seen as far south as indiana tonight but i am surrounded by trees and light pollution so i will not be able to tell until i am on the coast
it is also unknown if it could be seen at all this far south
it is all a guessing game that it could be visible here
let this post know if anyone on the midwestnortheast us canada border can see it
post your general location
we are borealis hunting lol
i woke up here in portugal at 0438am to find an unusually bright red light i have never seen before
i checked my night sky app and it suggested it could be saturn but it was red
0441 faro portugal 211 sw about 30 angle above horizon
it could be something else but only today i noticed and thought it would be worth asking as i cannot sleep without knowing something
thanks
title says it all amateur astronomer
love spending nights peering into my scope
besides the moon planets galaxies what else are your favorite or top objects to look at
especially to show to new or curious friendsfamily etc
for reference i am using a 12 dob scope and typically in good conditions bortle 23
and have all the standard fare lenses barlow filters etc
thanks and looking forward to everyone is input
i am currently in nyc bortle 9 obviously with a friend and he wants to drive out of the city to see the aurora which is expected to be visible from further south than usual the next few nights
however even if we get clear skies and an open view the north i am pretty skeptical we will find a place dark enough without driving crazy far
i have only seen the aurora once at it was at a bortle 1 at 78 degrees latitude
i have little idea what is possible in more light polluted skies and somewhere with trees in the way lol
we can be in bortle 5 in about 2 hours but by my standards that is not very good
is it enough to see aurora and if so will be actually be interesting or just a faint barely visible glow
tldr what is your experience seeing the aurora from light polluted skies
how dark do we need to get
does anybody know of an online list of double stars by constellation which can be observed from earth
i have found a list of double and multiple stars in turn left at orion online
which is pretty good but some of the star names there have unusual names which i cannot identify in stellarium
does anybody know of such a list
i build a pier in my backyard for my heq5 pro
total cost of about 70 euro
here is a video about it
i really liked jack horkheimer and his show star gazers and i was wondering if it might be possible to be able to find an episode relevant to the current date
they do make a modern show but it would be cool to be able to go back a couple decades and find something relevant to what i can see in my night sky
would i just look for one from the same week
or would i have to find relevant segments and piece it together
so i recently started putting my 12 dobsonian out for solar observing given that it is mostly cloudy during night time where i live during this time of the year
i really liked observing the sun spots and the entire solar disk and have decided to try my hands at the same
i have a 2 focuser with a 125 converter
i also possess a 125 2x barlow and a zwo asi 178 color camera
i was looking for solar photography tutorials and found that i do require a uvir cut filter
while searching for the same i came across the following what confuses me is what size of the filter to get 125 or 2
what all to keep in mind while getting a correctsized filter
these are not scientific articles so i already have my doubts but i cannot tell if they are actually referencing any good sources
i do not believe it so i am just waiting for scientists to make something of it all
are those articles really bs
or is there actually a chance that the big bang theory could be completely wrong given the information we receive from the jwst
there has been a flurry papers posted on the first jwst images of galaxies that seem to be almost impossibly early
i have seen some fringey articles about the results perhaps calling the big bang into question
here is a nonfringey article that touches on the situation from uconn
uconn article my understanding is that there is some question about whether the red shift used to date these galaxies is entirely accurate
with the caveat that we need to wait for complete data and peerreviewed papers i was just wondering if anyone else is following this potentially monumental story with interest andor insights
so the cmb shows unreasonable smoothness at this time
however how does that smoothness scale as we go back towards the big bang perhaps at the temperature scale of the release of the first photons
ampx200b
just wondering if the difference between direct to us hypotenuse and light reflected off the nebula two legs would show anything interesting beyond just the geometry
or are those two distances star to nebula too small to see any appreciable change in redshift
 edit thanks for youketarax for the light echos especially the video wow that is neat
hi has anyone figured out how to export a 3d model in mpo lcinvert
the model is rendered through opengl so theoretically it should be possible to export it as obj but i have not found a way yet
in the myriad of articles regarding this recent observation there is a lot of attention to the ability to actually detect real sound because of the gas clouds surrounding galaxies
this information is presented to counteract the usual hypothesis that sound cannot travel through space due to the lack of propagation medium by saying that there is an actual medium
what i want to know is where the telescope actually is how are we detecting these sound waves
surely the gas pressure extending from the black hole all the way to the chandra xray telescope is not being detected faithfully enough to convert it into sound waves
and how is an xray telescope collecting this data
what is the telescope actually measuring to pull out this data
i tried googling this and i am sure it is nontrivial
but to me combining the power of the current space based and possibly earth based telescopes could deliver some big changes in astronomy
are there any academic institutions working on a framework or platform to allow various scopes to tie their data feeds together
sorry if this is a dumb question
the 4 on the right it is like 
is the figure that we receive regarding the distance of a galaxy from usie
500 million light years the current distance of the galaxy
or is it the distance of the galaxy based on the light we are seeing todayie it took the light we see today 500 million light years to reach us and it has since moved many more millions of light years away
the last few weeks i have had a couple of longer viewing sessions and both times i got eaten alive by mosquitoes
the citronella candles on the first session did not seem to do much i had two of them burning within 5 of me
they are a few years old though i am not sure if that matters
the second viewing session i had purchased two brand new thermacell patio guards that are supposed to give a 15 diameter zone and both were within 6 of me
i have purchased a few of the bug bands repellent wristbands to try on the next one but i am not hopeful
any suggestions would be helpful
hi
i am a high school student who is interested in conducting astronomy research
i will hopefully have a mentor soon at a local university who is a professor in astrophysics
however i am having a bit of trouble knowing where i should start and how the full procedure for researching revising and publishing astronomy works
does anyone have any resources on where i can get started
i am interested in coming up with my own question to study as an original project and not to contribute to another research effort
ampx200b i have knowledge of basic physics and calculus if that info is important
for detail go here
what is a good video or good summary you seen on topic of universe infinite univerrese like when a youtuber says univerrese is expanding i guess what they mean is that univerrese humans can see is like 50 but it is what humans can see that is expanding maybe univerrese will expand to 1500 later on so now humans can see more of the infinite univerrese 1 if that is what smart people mean how is it that humans can see more
2 does the tech improve each day or year or something and than that is why humans can see more
do they use these tech and check the infinite univerrese every year and something
do they have a calendar set up or something that reminds them to check what is going on in the infinite univerrese every year to check the total size of univerrese 3 and the tech sees all this big stuff and then puts a number on it and says ok this is the total value and total of the univerrese of what humans can see currently i guess those smart people mean it is a infinite univerrese when they say that what humans can see is expanding 1 what about galaxies what basically counts as a galaxy like galaxyies can very very close to each other cannot they
1 say that humans had the tech to go to next nearest galaxyies and then next very very fast
the galaxyies could be close to each and it will be fine yea
there will not be any major negative effects of galaxyies being very close together yea
1 what does it mean when physist people wonder what is the shape of the univerrese
if the infinite univerrese is infinite how could there be a shape
1 is not good enough to know that the univerrese is 3d
1 what significant difference does or would it make if the infinite univerrese was infiinite or was not
what is good video or summary of all this stuff and topic of infinite univerrese
maybe a well made site that has like a few clear lines for each and it is in faq style with qampa and you can click on the next question if you are interested to show the science info and if you are not you can just go to the next question and click that one do you know of any good well made sites like this
 that has been made yet that covers this topic of infinite univerrese
visuals are definitely neeeded what is a good video or good summary you seen on topic of universe infinite univerrese
i was testing out my new glass solar filter on my 8 inch dobsonian telescope and noticed several dots passing quickly in front of the sun
i probably saw at least 1015 in the 5 minutes i was watching the sun
i am guessing they were satellites but did not think i would see so many in a short amount of time
article about a you of arizona astrophysics phd student with native hawaiian heritage and supported the antitmt protests when he was younger
excerpt tylers life is one of hard work and a passion for education and hawaiian culture
for instance in 2012 for his eagle scout service project he chose to restore an ancient hawaiian fishpond by removing invasive seaweed
fishponds were essential to the old hawaiian way of life
by helping to restore this fishpond i was reconnecting with the ways of my ancestors while also developing leadership skills as a boy scout
this is how i was being a boy scout in a hawaiian cultural lens he attended kamehameha schools kaplama in honolulu one of the campuses of a hawaiian private school system incorporating both academic excellence and a focus on hawaiian history and culture
after graduating he started college in pursuit of a degree in physics and mathematics
at the same time he worked several jobsat macaroni grill at nicos pier 38 and tutoring with uachieve and in the math department at the university of hawaii at mnoato help support his family
 and he realized that things he had been taught about the tmt through the bridge program were flawed including claims such as that the tmt would harm the islands water supply that it would be environmentally damaging that astronomy is big business and akin to a commercial development was motivated by financial greed
i already have friends in grad school that have job offers outside of astronomy for half a million dollars a year
they are turning it down to stay in astronomy
this is not about greed ampx200b
if a hypothetical super jovian planet has moons that are large enough to hold onto atmospheres and sustain their own intrinsic magnetic fields would these atmospheres still get ionized by the magnetic field of the planet and create a torus of charged particles
i know this happens most notably on io which is the source of much of the radiation in jupiters severe radiation belts
i am trying to imagine a gas giant that could host habitable exomoons and i am wondering if a massive planet could have a calmer magnetosphere than jupiter without its intense radiation belts
if there is no io equivalent and the moons closer to the planet can hold their atmospheres would that create a calmer environment for these moons to exist
that shows the location of particular stuff like the stars in the big dipper cygnus x1 the sun and so on
does anyone know of such a thing
it need not be three dimensional
i am a teacher and i would love to help orient my kids to the galaxy to reconceive the edgeon view they can see at night from the vantage point of the galaxy as a whole

just saw a post that dinosaurs existed when saturns rings were forming
so was there some kind of asteroid storm hitting planets that formed saturns ring and wiped out dinosaurs
note i do not have much astronomy knowledge just curious
hello astronomy
i am hoping someone could help me do some calculations or point me in the right direction as i am currently not finding the information i am looking for in my online searching
i am playing the game sea of thieves which takes place in a mysterious world through the veil
it has its own 24 hour day which takes 24 real minutes to complete and a solarlunar rotation
according to the wiki a solar eclipse will occur approximately every 28 in game days
the sun always rises in the east at 0500 and sets in the west at 2212 leaving 17 hours 12 minutes of sunlight to 6 hours 48 minutes of darkness per day
i do not have information on the moon yet
could someone point me to what missing pieces i need to gather to pinpoint eclipses and what kind of mathematical formula i am looking for
thank you in advance

hi folks i just noticed that one of the pillar seems like a sort of like an elf 
and wanted to share i know that this is surely just an optical effect generated by the human eye but i mean it is scary how detailed that face is
last night i was looking at the night sky and saw what was looking like a flickering light
i thought it maybe was just an airplane and decided to take a look at it through my telescope
when i did this the only thing i saw was a star which i later identified as aldebaran using stellarium that was rapidly changing from red to green and back
how does this work
is it just an optical illusion caused by my telescope
or is it something else
gtanother poster tried to put this up as a loweffort post linking a misleading clickbait article headline
it got removed but this does deserve some attention as it is a legitimate discovery
so let us see if i can do better

 detection by transiting exoplanet survey satellite tess backed up by groundbased telescopes team led by the university of montreal orbiting a reddwarf star makes a complete orbit of its star every 11 days the reddwarf star is small and cool so it receives a similar amount of light as venus about 100 lightyears away about 70 larger than earth and roughly five times as massive potentially rocky might be a water world or not might be a rock with little or no atmosphere could be a rocky planet with an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium so tbd
i am building an eq mount as part of a school project and am using a hole and pin style incremental altitude adjustment system to save on cost
what is the tolerance in altitude adjustment before things start to look weird for 1 hour exposures
located in orlando fl if that matters i cannot find anything that states an accuracy
only to set it to an altitude on google
i am currently using a differential hole adjustment mechanism which gives me step increments of 0947 degrees
i can easily bring that down but i need to know how far down i need to bring it

so i am wondering what the highest possible luminosity of a star feasibly is before the necesary energy would cause it to rip itself apart
i tried to find it but all i found where lists of the brightest stars and even then i could not narrow it to the brightest at its surface what i am asking or the brightest in the earths sky
so what is the highest possible luminosity of a mainsequence star where it is not necesarilly stable just psudostable so possibly past the eddington limit
i was thinking while brainstorming concepts for a short story about colonizing enceladus temperature is the transfer of kinetic energy which is done through three methods conduction convection radiation in space you would not freeze to death not instantly at least because there is no presence of air or water so you would not be in contact with anything
you would instead slowly radiate all of your heat into the emptiness of space
so my question i was thinking of on a planet with no atmosphere where there is no air would you freeze to death with no spacesuit on 
asides from the slow radiating of your body heat and if so would hovering above the surface of the planet affect whether or not you would freeze to death
edit this is assuming that the planet is quite far from the sun let us say 220 degrees celsius and yes i do know you would die from lack of oxygen and such i am not concerned about surviving just if heating or insulation is necessary on planets with no atmosphere
sorry for the long winded title
i want to be able to share the gift of astronomy to everyone regardless of their ability to purchase a telescope or not
would anyone be interested in creating a group that would donate to purchase a large amount of beginner telescopes to donate to public libraries as well as classrooms
i would be willing to spend my time distributing these telescopes across ny state
if you have interest in this idea i would love to create a group to talk more about this idea if there is interest
hi folks i have looked online and cannot find a solid answer if a coronal mass ejection hit earth would it affect both sides of the planet or just the sun facing side
cheers for any info
hey all hope all is well
i am trying to find a podcast or audio file that will help me learn the stars by star hopping
i would like to play it on my phone with earbuds in and just listen and follow the audio guide
i have asked several friends but all have said to download an app and hold your phone to the sky and follow along
for me this defeats the purpose of what i am trying to accomplish
i do not want to hold up a phone and steer the screen around the sky having to switch from looking at the screen and looking at the sky
i want to hear a narrator say locate the the big dipper then from the outer edge of the spoon arc northwards till you find the north star or polaris
from there you does this exist
any help would be greatly appreciated
thank you
3108 1240 am recently nasa officially announced that they have captured the sound waves of a supermassive blackhole of perseus cluster 250million ly 3108 1240 am since 2003 the black hole at the center of the perseus galaxy cluster has been associated with sound
this is because astronomers discovered that pressure waves sent out by the black hole caused ripples in the clusters hot gas that could be translated into a note one that humans cannot hear some 57 octaves below middle c now a new sonification brings more notes to this black hole sound machine 
first photo i took around 10pm second around 1am
iso 2500 and 30s exposure time
a bit of a celebration with some questions
i was taking a shot of the milky way last night and i noticed andromeda was bright and present so i had a thought
what if i took one of my portrait lenses 90mm f2 135mm ffe and tried to get a shot of andromeda
obviously i did not want star trails and this seems to be the sweet spot for exposureiso vs narrow field of viewi am hooked
i got such a rush from the mediocre picture haha
i was a teacher for 10 years but recently resigned and am now a full time photographer
at the school i had access to a meade 8 lx200 acf and i do miss using it but i never used it for astrophotography
so here is my question
as a photographer i have access to some really nice glass
from 18mm f18 to 600mm f8 wildlife lens lots of prime lenses and such
i have about 1000 budget
should i go towards a startracker and use the glass i already have fuji xf or invest in a proper telescope and adapt to that
that is to say is a 1000 telescope as good as photography glass with a star tracker to get started
the goal is to save up and maybe get a nice telescope but got to make sure my little girl can so soccer first haha
hello everyone
does anybody know what star this is

well i am making a material for understanding the work from real astronomer on my city but i cannot find a data base or a collection of images on tif format that i can use for this because i will use a platform called salsaj to analize those images
do somebody of you know where i can find them or has a link to images that i could use
my father is a huge astronomy nut and his birthday is coming up
he already has a heliocentric orrery and i think he would like having a geocentric one too as we both find epicycles really fun to watch
i understand that said epicycyles make the machine more complicated but are there any geocentric orreries that will not run me hundreds or thousands of dollars
the only ones i could find were made of gold and whatnot
hey folks my 1year wedding anniversary is coming up and my wife and i have recently gotten into astronomy
we are very much beginners but have an awb onesky and easy access to bortle 23 skies here in northern colorado
my question are there any particularly romantic ideas for objects we might look for eg
anything with a good story
thanks in advance
edit i found some ideas will need to determine which ones might be visible with my setup heart nebula soul nebula andromeda and perseus rosette nebula galactic rose arp 273 venus necklace nebula
last year i did the data driven astronomy course on coursera i really enjoyed it it was in some ways more a programming course than astronomy but there were lots of interesting coding challenges introducing you to things like machine learning and their application to astronomy
so i would like to do something in the same vein this year but i am struggling to find anything it seems difficult to find courses which have a similar practical aspect to them
does anyone have any recommendations
am particularly interested to hear from those who have done the above course
hello all i hope its okay to post this here i am starting a podcast and have fixed a few episodes already i am making sure i have a good amount prepared for release however i wanted to talk to someone about spacethe jw telescope and more this is not a conspiracy theories podcast or anything like that
if anybody is interested in recording an episode with me i would be delighted to talk

am i to believe that when the 1st stars turned on and into galaxies the material used to collate was condensed gas that was ignited by the immense pressure of the gravitational pull of the center of the star
but were not the 1st generations composed of the most simple atoms and from there transmuted into helium and up the periodic table so where did the big chunks of nickel iron and other hard surfaces come out of
did it take a couple of generations of cycles to build up to rocks and bigger materials
it is so amazing and unbelievable that we are here able to contemplate these happenings
can someone explain to me what is this thing i think it was captured march 27 2022 540 something
anybody know of a 3d render of the gaia 3 data release egdr3
hi everyone
i am an astronomy and astrophysics major taking observational astronomy
teach has not given us a ton of guidelines for our observing project so i am trying to get some opinions on the scope of my project
i am currently looking into studying an algol type eclipsing binary system called v342 aquilae catchy ik
it is a super interesting system in all respects but for my project i will have to convince a panel to give me telescope time and i am wondering what reasons are usually good for this
it seems it is a really understudied system all of its parameters were determined in the 90s and it does not look like they have been touched since
but i think remeasuring all of these is too wide of a scope for a one semester class
if anyone has time to learn a little about the star and let me know a why
and what
you think would be a good thing to use for my project please lmk in the comments
thanks and happy stargazing

just like how we can sometimes see space x launches would i be able to see artemis
i am not entirely sure where to find information on its path or if it is even possible
i am not sure if this will get removed but it is just a quick but confusing question
can other stars absorb heavy elements expelled from a supernova
or is that not even a thing
i am a high school student so i do not know how dumb of a question that is thank you

i am trying to find the stars luminosity but i am not understanding the equation for it
i think it has stefan boltzmanns constant and i just do not get it
anyways here are the things i am trying to figure out
mass lifespan radius luminosity density temperature habitable zone i did some research and in order to calculate the equations you divide the solar masses by solar luminosity and 1010
i am not sure if that is true or not
hi reddit i have been trying to research using colour indexmore specifically using bv filters to calculate the surface temperature of the star
i have researched quite a lot to really understand the ballesteros formula and i am still struggling to understand what each value really means and where they come from
i did find a couple of sources that had talked somewhat about the formula but did not explain anything about how they acquired the values and what they actually mean
they mainly used quite complex derivativesaccording to me and if someone can explain the values it will be really appreciated
the equation of ballesteros formula sources i found while i was trying to research this ampx200b thanks for your help
i have an 8 inch dobsonian and i want to attach my canon eos mark ii to it but i cannot find an adapter anywhere
i was wondering if i could get some help finding one
can someone please explain what i am seeing here
my phone has a sht camera but i need some kind of answer because i cannot get over what i saw
i swear there was more than one sun and i wish i was kidding so anyone have any idea please let me know
you have the sound of a star the sound of a black hole the sound of a planet
i mean it is just vibrations altered to the audible spectrum
this way you can produce the sound of light of xray of i find it more clickbait than science honestly
scientists have found over 70 wandering planets that are not attached to a star
what would be required for one of them to be drawn into our solar system by our suns gravity field
found this thing in my backyard while digging for a pool
i used a shoe for size reference 7 12 and this thing weighs probably 25 pounds
i am flabbergasted to read that in 1976 the life detection experiment on nasas viking mission to mars returned positive results which were subsequently dismissed
is it true that scientists have not followed up with new experiments to confirm or rule out
if so why waste 40 years ignoring such a spectacular opportunity to search for extraterrestrial life when we have since sent many robots to mars
is it possible nasa discovered life in the 70s
i believe the search for alien life is the most important unanswered scientific question the answer to which would show us what and who we are are we a fluke or just a thing that hydrogen atoms tend to do when left alone for 14 billion years

hi all i am having trouble with my 10 dobsonian that came with synscan
so far i have just used it for the remote control to move the telescope but had never been able to get the tracking figured out
i followed the guide but nothing has worked
here is what i normally do place telescope on flatlevel ground
make sure that it is pointing north and that the telescope is horizontal to the ground
put in the date time and my location
select which region of sky i am in
pick the first star and align the scope to it
then the telescope will move to the next star but will be completely off by massive margins like on the complete opposite side of the sky
even after correcting it it will not track correctly
if there is any suggestions on what i did wrong or if i am just blind here please let me know thank you
i am on a night time flight somewhere over the midwest right now likely kansas and i am observing what appears to be a light source illuminating the landscape
as the plane moves so does the illuminated patch of land
i have attached a video showing the phenomenon
does anyone know what is going on
its been going on for many minutes
it is truly one of the most surreal things i have witnessed
1 if those galaxies the hubble and jwst spot that are red are the furthest i assume this works when a deep field is taken is in any direction
2 how do we actually know the universe is expanding from these images not just galaxies moving away towards each other
hey visual amateur here
i am wondering if there is a way to know if we might be able to see artemis 1 orbiting the moon before the mission launches
i know it will be small but in the same way that we can see a moon passing over saturn i was hoping we might be able to see it bright against the dark side or a shadow over the bright side
is there a way to estimate if the craft will be too small for this
i want to recreate the kepler light curve in figure 3 of this paper
 in order to do this i want to download the lc data from the publicly shared dataset of shallue amp vanderburg 2018 that the authors use to recreate the lc but i am lost on how to download the data beyond first choosing the staridentifier here i am new to simbad so any assistance would be greatly appreciated
so i have been developing a concept for a pc space based strangely game lately complete with accurate data of our galaxy
i have already completed all the math and figured out the light year distances between each star and i have a list of about 350 stars or every star with in 30 lightyears from earth
this is my game boardhow do i represent this game board
how do you reduce 3 dimensional space to a 2 dimensional readout
i was contemplating making it a web map
start with the solar system in the center and list everything with in 10 light years
draw lines between those stars
then for each of those stars do the same
every star with in 10 lys listed repeats overlap and so the map branches out like a web from the central star
it could work or it could become a cluttered mess because the concepts of up and down would have to be factored in the map
does anyone have a good idea for good way to map the stars out with in the game
if we are measuring expansion by redshiftsvelocities of galaxies outside of our local group would not it take millions of years to confirm that expansion is still continuing or that it has ended
i am learning about the new horizon mission
how hard is it to navigate the kuiper belt
is not there a massive amount of space debris
how did we prevent the destruction of the space craft
i am not sure if this is the right place to post but i could not think of anywhere else
yesterday morning just before sunrise at 550am cst
i looked into the eastern sky as i do every morning while waiting for my shift to start
i see venus bright as ever
however there was another light right next to the planet
so much so that if i had put my pinky up it would have covered them both up
i was about to pull out my phone and check on my star gazing app to see what it was
within 10 seconds
i saw it disappear almost instantly
blew my mind
i have not stopped thinking about it since
i have looked online for an explanation but i have found nothing
is there a name for this kind of phenomenon
has anyone experienced anything similar
it is easy to find estimates on the distance of stuff from earth
eg
 andromeda 25m ly
sextans b 45m ly 
how can i find information on their distance from each other
is there an easy to understand 3d map of things in the universe somewhere
without knowing directions is could be anywhere from 2m to 7m ly
i am looking for a planetarium star projector for my bedroom ceiling that is accurate to my location
does something like this exist
i essentially want to see the constellations that would be above me as if i were outside looking at the sky
ampx200b
edit tldr need to compose the school program for an astronomy club and i have no idea what to do and how to do it
in my city there is no astronomy club only one at the local planetarium but it is hard to reach and the club is fairly small
so i decided to ask my school if i could start one and they said yes but i have to give them a program of activities and studies for her whole year and i have no idea what to do the students would be in age range from 15 to 18 so i do not want to go too much into the physicschemistry theories and stuff to not disinterest students
also worth mentioning we are in a scientific school specialized in chemistry but it is not the main interest of most students so i would not count on it and the club would be held by our geography professor so i do not think she knows a lot about physics anyway could anyone give me with any suggestion for a program
my first idea was about orientation in the night sky understanding where planets are moon phases to understand at which point of the month you are knowing how to recognize some basic constellations bright stars etc this would be the first unity
i know it is a lot of stuff but we cannot go too much into detail since we are limited to 1 hour a week and we cannot focus on only one unity for the whole year so what next
i believe i need to suggest at least 34 good unities i was thinking that learning about galaxies types star types dso black holes etc would be interesting but i am not sure how to make it all work together connect it also making it easy to explain by a geography professor and interesting for students i am afdaid students could get overwhelmed by a lot of theory they cannot see and completely understand thus making them bored
any idea
also i am not sure if we would be allowed to go to the planetarium here and there but maybe just maybe we could go to the school roof when it is dark but most probably not around 730pm school here is both in the morning and evening changing every other week
i am trying to find this video i saw the other day on reddit that had this crazy cgi shot from the surface of one of the jovian moons it had jupiter filling the entire horizon
made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
anyway the video had quite a few other cgi shots of the solar system and i cannot remember what it was called and i really want to feel small and unimportant again lol so if you think you know the video i am on about could you pls post a link in the comments
cheers
i get it deep woods off is hands down the best
but i am really trying to get away from chemical repellants and looking for something that is natural
i have tried quite a few things even rubbing citronella oil on me
what do you all use
and most important what really works
this is something i have been mulling over lately that i would like your guys opinion on
so we humans understand that everything in the universe has to come from something
something cannot come from nothing
everything that exists had to be caused by something else before it
for example the universe was caused by the big bang the universe cam from the big bang
but i ask what caused the big bang
the problem with this is the standard law of because and effect would not apply since there was no concept of time before the bb
so basically what i am trying to say is what ever created the initial singularity if something did would not abide by the laws because and effect meaning it does not have to need something that caused it since that would imply that time exists which it did not before the big bang
so this thing would have to exist beyond time itself it does not need something to cause it is existence
we humans would not be able to even fathom that because we understand that everything has to come from something
so the thing that caused the big bang was timeless and it was also spaceless
since there was no space before the bb either
and if it is spaceless then it is also matterless too since matter takes up space
so this thing is spaceless matterless and timeless
as for my last question what is the did not between something that is timeless matterless and spaceless and something that does not exist
hey
i want to know the ra and dec of the centre of the sky above me i know it changes with time so how do i calculate it at a particular place and time on earth thank you in advance for helping me out 
after watching this astrum video on using spot robots to explore the martian surface i wanted to see what other think of this possibility
and to also share what i think some pros and cons would be
the premise behind the video is how these robots could be the replacement for rovers with wheels
the wheels make traveling across terrain difficult and limited
the rovers also cannot help themselves as efficiently when faced with a problem such as the opportunity rover having a rock sample crumble and block the port for depositing the samples into the internal compartments
though they did solve this problem it was a difficult feat to accomplish
another problem with rovers is martian dust covering solar panels and limiting the power it can gather from the sun
spot has shown that it can correct itself from falls traverse loose and unstable terrain and move much faster than a rover
they also would be more dependent on ai for traveling and would not need as much guidance from earth which is hindered due to the delay of signals at that distance
spot robots can work as teams to assess problems and possibly fix any issues one of the bots might have such as dust inside one of their parts or wiping dust off solar panels
working as a unit would allow greater and more efficient exploration sample collection and possibly aid in building the first martian settlement
they would be able to travel in caves which rovers cannot access or map giving us a better idea of what is under the surface and what mars looks like when not faced with solar radiation since the cave could preserve these details
i think the spot rovers could be instrumental in colonization of mars
they could allow permanent settlements to exist before humans even step foot on the martian surface making it safer for human colonization of the red planet
i have heard some say the spot robots could be hindered by their complex design which could mean they fail more easily under the harsh conditions
though i think the moving parts can be shrouded to limit dust in the joints it still could be a possibility of failure
though it could be possible that a team of spots could fix the issues if one of the bots has a failure like this
power supply also could be an issue
the robots are smaller and would not really be able to gather much solar energy unless they had large panels that extended passed the frame of the body
these robots also might use power faster and need a more efficient source to operate
i have heard talks of using nuclear batteries though i do not believe there are not any at a size which could be usable on these bots
another idea might be a power station where the spot robots could recharge instead of carrying panels or a heavy battery
would love to hear others thoughts on this concept
is this the future of martian exploration or is this too complex and prone to failure
how do you think engineers will solve the shortcomings of these robots and what ramifications could this have on colonization of mars
thank you for reading this far and hope you learned something or have some interesting input on the subject
hey everyone
i am a high school senior that is the new president of my schools astronomy club
it has not been very active and i am kind of restarting it and i was wondering if anyone had any ideas as to what we could do in the club that is interactive
thanks
hey
i am a writer and i cannot understand these articles and their moon speak as well as i think they are missing out on details
basically if the moon moved 100 in sync with the earth which makes it essentially relatively stationary how would this affect seasons time water anything
i need it all
editplease try and keep the language kind of simple for my dumb brain
i would like to compute if moon or planets are visible at a given location time and sky position
planets usually appear in like nautical twilight venus sometimes can be visible when sun is still up and the moon if it is high enough
what i want is to be able to estimate when the moon and planets can be visible naked eye
now for this i use a tool at time and date but it is sometimes not accurate and i want to be able to estimate moon and planets visiblility in a program
here is something i found but i do not like 1 stellarium code from github it just compares btwilight with bdaylight and takes the highest of two so there is not much difference if sun is setting soon or it is 45 up
2 physically based night sky at page 5 they just add 04 mag to account for scattering and it seems it does not say a word about air mass
i also looked some more articles but they look only at twilight conditions or only at daytime conditions
is there a good algorithm for this or at least an approximation formula
anybody know if there is a calculator program that will let you convert between solar units
the calculators built in conversions do not go that high and i have not been able to find one
i teach highschool science and have a few high achieving students looking to do astronomy science fair projects
the challenge is taking measurements is often beyond the capability training equipment funding time of a student
but i know there are resources out there of data already gathered by astronomers for others to use
i would love to gather a bunch of data resources for them
essentially the public catalogues and measurement databases
measurement tables distances redshifts bv indices etc etc light curves spectra etc
image catalogues i am starting to dig around myself but figured others in the community might know a few good resources and if you happen to know of a type of research that is great for an amateur starting out that would be awesome too
i am trying to photograph a recently launched satellite the bluewalker 3 would anyone be able to help me do this
 it is straightforward to me that they can be destructive because the uv radiation ionizes gas in the molecular cloud to push it away and the stellar winds blow a bubble around the star
i do not understand how these same characteristics trigger star formation
not from the naked eye of course but it seems plausible to me that we would be able to measure the head and tail of other stars heliospheres and would be able to use that to aid hypothesis in age direction of orbit etc
i am looking for a website similar to biorender where you can create astronomy publicationquality figures with premade icons and templates
does anyone know any sites
let us say we have a binary star system is there any way for a planet to wind up between them
created this world for a scifi and had an argument with my buds it may not be possible but is this idea way outside the realm of possibility
like for example would a panel under a super red giant make less power than a panel under a white dwarf
or something along those lines
kind of astronomy related i do it as a hobby in my yard whatever no fancy equipment i live kind of in the suburbs and my neighbor across the street recently got a fancy led garage light that he just leaves on all night every night it probably does not make the biggest difference since i am not taking pictures or anything but trying to star gaze spot satellites is kind of annoying to literally have shadows in your yard
i guess my question is at what point do you ask a neighbor to chill with the lights
they just added two spot lights near a man door that shine their house up
with me just star gazing as a hobbyist like 23 times a month on the nice nights is there an approach you have found to not sound petty
fwiw i have been in my house about 2 years now and talked to the guy once or twice when my boxes got delivered to his house do not know him or his name
i do not know if this is the right place to ask but is there a survivable distance from the sun that the radiation will not give us skin cancer
hello i am reading a book called brief welcome to the universe and i have a question
now it is stated that if the fluctuation were due to the gravity of uneven distribution of matters masses in space after the 380000 of the big bang then it would be a part of 1 in 10000 but that is not the case where the fluctuation is a part of 1 in 10000 and the writer accredited this to the existence of dark matter but i am not sure i get why is that
i recently found that solar eclipses are actually quite common
on average once every 18 months or so there is a type of solar eclipse somewhere on earth
this made me wonder about new moons
when a new moon passes the sun on its westward journey there is an 185 chance it will create some sort of eclipse
 so my question is what is the furthest in degrees as viewed from earth not actual distance from the sun and moon that the new moon would be from the sun as it passes by the sun
hello
i have recently seen some conflicting information about sagittarius a and our galaxys orbit
many sources say sag a is at the center of our galaxy and thus everything revolves around it while it is relatively motionless while others say our orbit is defined by the combined gravity of all relative objects such as sag a which is near the center of our galaxy and other nearby bodies of considerable mass
either way i am also curious of another thing do we know if the milky way orbits any particular object
thank you for your help
can a planet have an orbit around two suns
ie can it do a figure of 8 around the two suns
meaning can it go round one sun then when it gets to the middle it goes around the other sun
so it is about 4am in england and i was out having a smoke
i swear i saw something resembling a star float king from right to left just under betelgeuse the top left star in the orion constellationwith the naked eye plus glasses i thought at first it might be a plane but i looked closer and saw only one light okay maybe a satellite
but i watched it for a second or two and then it vanished
no clouds or anything it was a totally clear night
just wondering if anyone knows what i saw
i have an apertura 10 in dobsonian all stock
i cannot zero my finderscope
the screws whether i unscrew or rescrew do not seem to move the crosshair much so i cannot get it on point i have to use kentucky windage
i think i may have tightened the spring screw at one point and wonder if this is impacting things but am unsure
does anyone have any guidance to factory reset the scope
thanks for any help

i am on a vacation for a week in stockholm and living in a house in the outskirts of the city looks like the light pollution here is fairly low
does anybody know if there is a place to rent a telescope in stockholm
is it likely there are more undiscovered planets after neptune not only one planet x usually searched for
i am a university student at usu on a design team sending a cubesat to space in 2024 this is the same team that sent gaspacs to space in early 2022 becoming the worlds first completely undergraduate cubesat
our secondary payload for the 2024 mission is a scientific camera more specifically a modified version of the teledyne moment cmos camera
we are undecided on the cameras mission and are open to suggestions
full spec sheets for the camera are available on teledynes website
additionally with this being a cubesat we are limited on space so deep space photography is unlikely due to size restrictions
with that in mind please let us know what ideas you have for our project
hi i do not need a book that covered wide ranged of astrophysics topics
im looking for a book that covered specific topics like planetary positions and others in the link below
it would be great the book explained with images
 ampx200b thank you
recently learned that gnz11 is one of the oldest galaxies we know about
the grainy photo from hubble is famous but have they taken a new shot from webb yet
soooo can we say that for example a galaxy that we observed 3 millions years after the big bang could it be that it is the same galaxy we see it now at example 3 millions light years for us
example big bang happened 3 millions years later after big bang we have galaxy a and countless others of course but let us focus in this particular one now with jwst we can observe billions and billions of light years to the past could it be that now galaxy a is only at 3 millions light years from earth just an example of course think of it like life itself we start as babys till we are old could the same galaxy that was 3 millions after the big bang be the same galaxy as andromeda
as an example
i always wanted to figure out how the navicomputers in star wars worked
star trek indeed uses pulsars and nasa or darpa is planning to one day use it
are there enough pulsars present in an average galaxy that could make navigating a galaxy possible
i want to simulate rings around a planet and see the shadows they cast on the surface
i need it for a fantasy setting where the planet is basically the earth with a shorter year and maybe a different tilt angle
i know only about universe sandbox but i am not sure how if it has this option
 this is a very good site
hi
i am thinking of starting an astronomy blog as an excuse to learn more about my favorite subject and also document my findings and maybe even dataanalysis with astropy and mlnn
i am not going to promote the blog here because i am pretty sure that is not allowed but if you were to read an astronomy blog what kind of infotopicstypes of astronomy would you want to see
news
general knowledge
courselike info on things we have known for a while but might not be the best explained
unofficial research and analysis on datasets
i am pretty new to this stuff so it will take some time to learn but i am very interested in starting this blog and some of my friends may be helping as well
thanks to those who reply
we have had so much rain and not it is 1203 and i am out walking the dogs and i saw a flaming object just north of san francisco moving across the sky
it was amazing and if it was a shooting star i have never seen one so low and close
it was over the pacific ocean
how do i find out about these things
maybe a meteorite
sorry for noob question
i have celestron powerseeker 127 eq with a handful of varying eyepieces
i am just wondering that if i would be able to see it when i should be watching in hopes to see the rocket going to the moon
ps
we have seen the iss albeit kind of blurry using this telescope
i really would like to see it for the sheer awe of it all and to send pictures to my flat earther brother who thinks there is a bubble shield around the earth
i am working on a speculative biology project and wondering about the habitability of planets orbiting mdwarfs
i know that m dwarf stars emit intense solar flares which is thought to pose a potential problem for the emergence of life on planets that orbit them
but i was wondering if the life that might exist in the terminator region could be protected from these flares simply by the angle that the photons would hit the atmosphere make it so that those higher energy wavelengths would be filtered out
these terminator regions would basically be in a state of perpetual sunset
during evening on earth only the longer wavelengths reach us and we are not exposed to much if any

is this a reasonable explanation for how life could emerge on these planets
so almost everyone i have ever met from every imaginable background brightens up and is totally alive and energetic when they talk about all the mind boggling aspects of reality
things like how the universe started so infinitesimally small and now is so massive and contains all this diversity
things like the famous smallest to largest comparison in the universe philosophy of mind how material things like skin central nervous system brain etc
can give rise to immaterial qualia things like feelings emotions consciousness etc
how words and concepts can create logical problems that are near unsolvable because those words and concepts are themselves geared towards a linguistic sense and not a philosophical sense
how things like color taste and other phenomenal reality do not exist independent but are an interaction of systems
the profoundness of how changes in reality can create whole new dimensions of reality
so within astronomy what are some things you have learned that you always go back to as the big mind boogling things you have learned and love thinking about 
so recently i have finally decided that i want to get a tattoo
it took me years to decided what i wanted to get on my body and i have decided the solar system
this is typically a pretty common tattoo however i would like to make the distance between each planet as close to proportional to the actual distance between planets in our solar system
all i know is that they are super far away from each
this being said i want each planet to land on a different part of my body starting with the sun and ending with neptune i would also love to do something reminiscent of the asteroid belt
can someone help me figure out about where each planet would land if i am a 53 female and i want the sun to start at my neck and neptune to end at my foot
this obviously does not have to be exact considering i do not have the measurements of my legs or torso but i would love an approximate answer
if anyone could help with this i would appreciate it so much
thank you for your time with this silly request
update thank you everyone who helped me figure out how far to space the planets
i appreciate it more than you guys know and cannot wait to talk it out with a tattoo artist
i will be sure to post pictures once it is done
i am pretty sure this is not against any rules
apologies if i am wrong
hey all i am 15 years old and for the past couple months i have gotten really interested in space and therefore also astronomy and physics
i barely have any physics in school and when i do have it it is things i already know from reading stephen hawking
i really do not have anything to do with these new interests of mine
that is why i am here because maybe you have better ideas than me
what astronomy related things can i do at home like for fun
a hobby
i have been reading lots of books about astrophysics and physics in general but i get so tired from school that i am sometimes too tired for reading
i would like to have something else too i know space observation like telescopes and astrophotography are two great ones but i do not have enough money to get a telescope
for the last months i have been saving money to buy a skywatcher heritage 130p but it is going to take a couple months to get enough money i will be able to buy it in maybe january
so until january i basically do not have any space related things to do
are there any space things i could do from home
thanks
i once read a book on black holes by a popular scientist and i think it was carl sagan
but i cannot find this book on the web anymore not on amazon and not in sagans bibliography on wikipedia either
so now i am wondering whether perhaps it was not sagan but someone else
what i do remember very clearly though and what made the book stand out is that it did not take the usual line of explanation of presenting light gravity how gravity has a pull on light and how therefore it is possible for gravity to be so strong that light cannot escape
instead this book followed the line of reasoning that sufficient gravity can make a star collapse into a white dwarf by breaking up the atoms into protons electrons and neutrons and from that state a further increase in gravity can solidify that entire soup into a neutron star and a still further increase in gravity can lead to a collapse of the neutrons into well into nothing which would be an infinite collapse into a black hole
solved isaac asimov the collapsing universe
the story of black holes
hello people my work group and me are at the observatorium de la cote dazur atm and we want to analyse data from diffrent starclusters calculating age using sextractor
unfortunately nobody get the programm installed and i want to know if someone has experience with this programm or even get it to install on mac monterey 124 
or do you know some software which is suitable for our project 
thanks in advice
stardate mentioned a possible rain of fire over the midwest tomorrow
can anyone give me more information on this possibility
i cannot find any other mention of this on the internet

hi i am a 15 yo ib student from south asia
i have loved astronomy for years and i always always wanted to do research in this field
i assumed this would be a good year to look for research opportunities for various reasons i plan to base my extended essay ib component on physics i want to have a realtime experience to see if i am willing to dedicate the rest of my life to research
it would be best if i carried it out nowsummer of 12th grade because i will be occupied with ib exams and college apps next year planning to go to the us for uni
in my country though none of the local colleges offer astronomy nor do we have many research programs running for high schoolers
the research programs online like lumiere edu are very very expensive and i cannot join them
currently i am looking at coldemailing professorspostdocsgrad students
i am very interested in cosmology astrophysics and observational astronomy
it is just that i do not know how exactly i can independently helpcarry out research remotely online
also i am not sure how to go about this process because i do not know where to look for postdocsgrad students like should i look through linkedin or are there any other places
ampx200b i have aboveaverage grades and my physics teacher said i have excellent hs level research skills and i can def explore them at a higher level
i really want to explore astronomy this way because everything seems so exciting i love reading about others research and hope to do the same one day
however i do not know what is the best way to go about itwhere i should start
any tips or feedback would be much appreciated
thank you
ampx200b
hello
has anyone here worked with xmmnewton data using the sas software
i am having trouble using it after initializing and the help desk has not been much help
the thing
just saw this in the sky
went in for another few seconds then the tail disappeared
and shortly after it was completely gone
so i was watching a tiktok earlier today about how the universe is expanding so what is it expanding into and that was answered by a guy who said that we are kind of limited by our ability to only see the observable universe where light has had time to reach us
my query is this
how can there be an unobservable universe
if my understanding is correct the existence of the universe started with the big bang which can be very vaguely explained as all matter and energy in a tiny space suddenly ejected outwards
that ejection of matter is subject to the physical laws of the universe so no travelling past c for any individual reference frame
how then can areas of the universe be invisible to us
if all matter was ejected at less than the speed of light surely we would be able to see that matter flying away from the central big bang location
admittedly that light would be very very old once you get to the farthest points away but it should still be there right
therefore there should not be areas of the universe that are unobserved but have millennia old photons that are only now arriving
very possible that i am extrapolating my understanding wrong here but is there any eli5 kind of reasoning for the definition of the observable universe
at work at a beach club happened to look up and see this
located in lower ny
at first i thought it might have been a plane in a cloud but then it disappeared
think it is an asteroid or comet
what do you all think
just curious
is it possible to see saturns rings faintly with the naked eye
cuz i feel like i can see them midwest usa for location if that is meaningful
the two pictures are about 1 minute apart
this was in south west canada
the moving lights were there and then dispersed very quickly
if the rate of expansion of space is speeding up would that make the universe be younger than it seems
i am sure this has been thought of
thank you
more information about the supernova which is a valuable type ia can be found at and the hubble observations specifically are described at 
i created this color image myself from our observations comprised of the hubble f814w red f625w green and f475w blue filters
at the given redshift these are actually pretty close to truecolor rgb
the data were processed in the standard hst calibration pipeline aligned with deizzlepac and the combined with astropy
hey you all i work with an organization that runs full moon events and we were recently contacted by a potential participant for an event that pointed out that the moon will not be crossing the meridian on a given night
they seemed to imply that there would not be a visible full moon but after looking at moonrise calendars it seems that the full moon will indeed rise that night in our area
just hoping to confirm if the lack of a meridian passing is relevant or not for the visibility of the moon
apologies for this being a very basic question i just spent about 15 minutes looking for an answer online and somehow came up empty handed
much appreciated
friend and i just saw what looked like an extremely bright meteor over atlanta but i cannot find anything about it
anyone else
do people just go out and look for random stuff with their telescopes or do yous have a bit more of methodical approach and do a bit of research before and set objectives for yourself
so last night i looked at what i believe to think is jupiter it was quite amazing and through a old cheap telescope i saw jupiter which had a blue colour on one side and orange on anotheraswell as what i believe it think is the 4 moons
what would those blue and orange colours be
and when i zoomed in on my telescope i got a grainy grey dot whereas when it was further out the definition and quality of the image was way better what could of caused that
hi reddit i have been curious if i can use the variable highlighted for finding the temperature
i was first calculating mag lambda but i already had that found from simbad so i worked backwards to find flux density for each star but i do not know if i can use that info to find temperate or not
can i use this variable in any way to find the temperature of a star
if it is not possible can i find the values for the highlighted variable for individual stars
thanks for help
i have been trying to figure out how simbad has the values for each colour filter for a very long since i have been studying stars recently
do they use zero point photometry to calculate individual magnitude or use black body diagrams to find maximum intensity and then use other equations to get to those colour magnitudes
can someone let me how they actually acquire those values like for uvb filters
is anyone able to identify the names of the moons
i am looking for a website or book that gives opposition and elongation dates for each planet along with the distance to earth for that opposition maybe over the next 20 years or so
unfortunately right now if you look for it you just see this years jupiter opposition
i have seen a few that give dates but not distances and some that only talk about a specific planetwhich i cannot even find anymore
thanks
i have seen lots of articles in the past few days about jupiters closest approach to earth in 70 years
they all say not to miss this once in a lifetime occurrence
that is a nice headline but i am wondering if its noticeably closer than any regular old opposition
i have found some numbers from this website 8202021 distance 401au magnitude 29 size 480 9262022 distance 395au magnitude 29 size 488 11022023 distance 398au magnitude 29 size 484 from this i gather that it will appear about 16 bigger tonight than last year and next years opposition will be nearly the same as tonight
not sure i would notice a 1 bigger jupiter through my telescope
is my interpretation of this accurate
we hit the asteroid
yay
jupiter and pleiades i just started
has anyone of you managed to use aladin on mac os bigsur 1168 
i am trying to figure it out but cannot find any solution yet 
bonus there is a free 11 page 5mb pdf sample of the ebook investigating alien life available here however i note that this is also enrolled in amazons kindle unlimited so if you already subscribe to that you can get the whole thing for free anyway d
this was the night that jupiter was closer than ever
it was crazy how much detail was spotted with just 2x zoom
i am working on a science fiction story in which muslim and chinese people have settled the moon and imposed names from their own cultures on landmarks like the sea of tranquility
i know there are many craters named after chinese and muslim people but i am looking for older traditional names from the chinese and islamic worlds
what is the sea of tranquility in other languages
hi guys i am having some trouble shining my laser pointer through my telescope beam is out of focus and cannot be used to align the telescope with the celestial objects
all help is appreciated happy gazing 
happened yesterday around 7 pm in pa area
can it be the asteroid that got hit 
i have searched the recommended binoculars on this subreddit but it is a little less clear on what is the idea choice for kids
i saw somebody recommend the canon is 15x50
it is going to be mostly spontaneous and short looks at the moon and planets from my front or back yard in my suburban neighborhood
i know people say telescopes are better for planets but it is a lot of setup and unattractive
 since the tidal bulge is always in the same place how would that affect ocean tides
would they change throughout an elliptical orbit due to changing distance from the star
how exactly would they behave
and would tides on a tidally locked moon behave the same way
we have been trying to configure the scope with not much luck
it seems to be lined up properly but when we look through it the image is either too blurry when magnified a lot or clear enough but has no magnification
i have played around with adapters and whatnot but nothing seems to work
ideas
please tell me if i am wrong i do not have a telescope by the way
how would an astronaut in orbit describe changes in their orientationposition
i have found references to eme2000 as well as the system of right ascensiondeclination
but reading up on how they work these seem more useful in either deep space or measuring the location of a celestial body relative earth
every article i find seems to be interested in deep space orientation or else tracking orbital bodies around earth not how the movement of a small object in earths orbit would be described from its own pov
specifically i am wondering how you would describe orientationsteering if you were personally floating in earth orbit
if i am on a flat plane on the earth and need to turn i can use either cardinal directions or using my current orientation as the reference point clock face directions to describe my turn
if i am flying an airplane i can assume the default way to fly is parallel to the ground and use roll pitch and yaw based on that assumption
but imagine you are in an advanced spacesuit with thrusters that give 360 degree movement
to get back to my space station i need to change my trajectory and communicate what i am doing with command
what would be the most intuitive system to both notate my current position and communicate how i must reorient myself
thank you
i took this picture at 605 am on 92122 in west des moines iowa
it was west to northwest of my location but i was on a run and did not have anything other than my phone to document it
it was there for at least 15 minutes
it did not move or change as far as i could tell but i eventually lost track of it as i continued with my run
the colors in the photo are accurate to what i recall and the dark diamond shape was well defined and unlike any clouds or other objects in the sky that i have seen
ampx200b i am assuming it was a searchlight or something similar but i have never seen that before or since
took this picture yesterday morning in croatia near sukosan around 6am
just wondering what the second bright spot on the picture is

does anyone here know if there are any observatories open at night to the public in new south wales australia
i have been trying to view jupiter lately with 7 x 50 binoculars and have been struggling to get them to work i can just see a white dot with no detail and when i zoom in it is very blurry and has no detail
i have to make a mathematical model for a lunar landing module for my computer science college but i cannot understand how orientation works in space
i tryed to read something about this online specially this article what that say is there is many points of reference in universe to use that will orient your destination but how to properly use this because everything is moving you are moving your point of orientation is moving your destination is moving and if that was not difficult enough i cannot use something like latitude and longitude because the moviment is threedimensional what about de height
can anyone at least put me on right track any tip would be very appreciated
dusting off my old reddit account
hello rastronomy i am sorry for the length i am extremely wordy
i am not sure how much help i can get but i can try
i am currently a senior astrophysics and mathematics double major and i should have realized after even my intro astrophysics course back in freshman year felt like a chore but i am not sure even a mathbased job is something i would be good at or like especially considering my motivation in my classes has always been really low i am just lucky enough to be naturally good at it
i pass my classes with good grades but as soon as it gets difficult at all i just give up it is not something i am ever interested in
this is obviously very late to realize this but there is been a lot happening in my personal life that led me to just say good enough on a lot of parts of my life including my degree
the isolation of the pandemic and a year of wild changes in my life has led to me fixing a lot of the personal stuff and really looking at my degree and realizing how much i do not and have not enjoyed astrophysics at a higher level than hobby
it is all just work to get done and i never indulge in astrophysics outside of school besides going to an observatory i have access to every couple of months
sorry for the very long intro this is honestly not a depressing topic to me since it is been bugging me and i am finally trying to solve it but i wanted to make it clear it is not a problem with disliking education because quite frankly i love school and the prospect of getting to teach is something that is kept me attached to astrophysics even if i did not love learning it
with all this said i have a million hobbies that i take part in from painting to playing an instrument to cooking to decorating and they are always very creative and things i tend to prioritize over my work most times even though i know i should not
it is clear i am not being creatively fulfilled with astrophysics and i understand there is creativity to research and teaching but it is still very analytic
the only time i have felt creatively fulfilled in an academic sense is in my music classes and computer science classes but i feel like the creativity in most computer science jobs gets sucked away int he corporate sphere
there is famously a large number of jobs open to stem grads even outside of degrees that use the math you have learned but i am wondering if there is any fields grad school welcome if needed that like having stem grads that leans more to the creative side of the spectrum
thank you for reading
i am not sure if astronomy is a great place to post this and i will probably find other places that might know more about jobs outside of astronomy to ask as well

saturday night is international observe the moon day
take out your telescopes invite the neighbors and do some observing
the fort worth astronomical society is having inperson star parties in our area that night for whose who want to look through telescopes sometimes for the first time in their lives
for those still at home or perhaps not in the dallasfort worth area i will have a livestream virtual observing night on youtube looking at the moon jupiter saturn and other objects as the night progresses
the chat will be open to questions and if there are any special requests i will do my best to accommodate
this star cluster is among the nearest to our solar system
 on page 2 of 25 it reads we excluded sources with a renormalised unit weight error ruwe larger than 14 likely indicating poor quality astrometric solutions for these sources
this leaves 4626 sources what does this mean
i have an assignment where i have to record the moon for 4 days in a week with a span of 5 weeks
would this be a good time to get good views of the moon
i live in florida
this is more so a hypothetical question but is it possible to visually observe dsos at stacked and processed image quality
and if so what size of apurture would i need
hello
i hope this kind of post is ok my girlfriend has always loved space and the stars so i want to get her a nice telescope for our 4th anniversary next month
what recommendations do people on the sub have
i have a limit of about 200 and am curious what people use and like
if this falls under poorly researched let me know
i have read a couple articles on telescopes but i always like to get recommendations from a community to paint a more comprehensive picture
i am going to use rvsao to do cross correlations and get rv measurements but i was wondering if there are any newer more robust better packages out there i should use for cross correlations
if not does anyone happen to be familiar with rvsao
came up in discussion with friends and none of us have any idea
i have attempted a google search not gotten anywhere
thank you
i am not even an amateur astronomer just someone who picks up information
but it seems to be a 100 certainty there is microbial life out there most likely even in our own system
so the chance that there is intelligence life out there is at least above 0 it seems like we are putting too much effort into studying the foundation of a house the origins and makeup of universe instead of going outside and talking to the other people outside seti
and for the longest time talk of aliens was dismissed and regarded as conspiracy or crazy thought when it seems like it is more of a reality that is not as threatening or outlandish as we first thought
hi guys
please forgive my stupid question in advance
ampx200b i am taking this for granted but how do we know there is not another planet on the other side of the sun
ampx200b like we can observe the planets in our solar system because they have these elliptical orbits that are not insync or at the same rate as the earth
what if there is another planet that orbits the sun at the exact same speed as earth but it is just on the other side of the sun
again i reiterate i am confident that modern technology and astronomy has proven this not to be the case but i just do not know how
i understand the kepler telescope identifies potential exoplanets by detecting drops in light from stars as planets orbit them and momentarily are in a position to block light
but does not this rely on the fact that the orbital inclination must be perfectly lined up with the telescopes pov
i do not understand how this works
i have noticed couple of weeks ago that the merak star of big dipper the bottom right one is more orange than usual whiteblue does anyone know why or has anyone noticed it too
i am based in southern spain for reference
i was sitting in a group meeting today and a professor kept using these terms in the context of the carina nebula
what do they mean
since we observe the center of our galaxy from roughly 25k years ago and the outer reaches of the other side from roughly 75k years ago do illustrations of our galaxy account for the visual distortion
more to the point how would the andromeda galaxy which we see almost on edge look if the 220k years difference between the near edge and the far edge were reduced to the same moment in time
in other words the tail on the far side is already 220k years further along than the near side tail as we see it
i was examining sirius from northern new jersey in the early morning 3am using just 12x42 powered binoculars
partly cloudy conditions no precipitation
very clear local visibility
a lot of light noise masks most of the stars but sirius is very bright
i was captivated by the higher amount of twinkling going on along with what seemed to be flashes of white blue and red
at first i had thought it was an aircraft until after a minute with no movement i realized it had to be sirius
with the unaided eye it looked like sirius was the only star flickering but under magnification i could see a couple of other stars very faintly showing some flicker with some color
but what made me curious is that when focused clearly on sirius and then moving up a degree or two to examine a faint star i had to adjust focus
given the enormous relative distance of the stars from the observer with small handheld magnification i would think no focus shift is required
is it because of light being refracted through a much longer distance through the atmosphere that even a couple of degrees is enough difference to require focus change
does anyone have a clue why the merak star in big dipper the right bottom one seems to be more orange than the usual bluewhite
observed on southern spain for past 14 days
so i have been spending a lot of time working on a gamebook concept that is high fantasy with scientifically accurate roots woven into its core
the story takes place in a system with a blue star
the core world is a habitable moon that exists in a polar orbit around a large gas or ice giant
it is orbital rotation largely leaves it in the presence of the star to allow the moon to remain habitable only going out of the suns view blocked by the planet once during the planets revolution which occurs once every 80 or so years and lasts no longer than a few days
my question stems from what i personally would think is the best set piece to be viewed in the sky and i have come to the conclusion a deep blue ice giant similar to neptune may work best but i need to know if there is enough plausibility for it to make sense from a scientific perspective
the time frame for the revolution of the planet is not finalized by the way
i do not actually know how long it would take a planet to orbit in the habitable zone of a system with a blue star as the habitable zone would be much further out than it is around our own star especially if the star itself was bigger than our own
i am attempting to do crosscorrelations with my stellar absorptions lines and a synthetic spectrum template to derive a radial velocity
i am new to doing crosscorrelations and am using the library specutils but i am having some issues
is anyone familiar with this process and if so could they pm me
i am under a time crunch
i used to use website called calskycom that had a nice daily graph of the planets moon etc
it showed the direction degrees in the sky the riseset times and the path they followed
i see the website is no longer active
what other sites do you use to see where things will be in the sky
assuming that the stronger the gravity the slower time passes for you is it reasonable to assume that time passes faster in between galaxies where i assume has less mass densitymass per amount of space
hi everyone
for the past few months or so i have been working on creating an astronomy club in my high school i am 16f and i finally got a supervisor
sadly he knows nothing about astronomy but i am still very excited
i created a list of what we could do such as charting constellations zooniverse space projects which i briefly researched building a telescope and just keeping up to date on nasa news
scifi movies are also on the table
many of us have an amateur coding background
currently i believe stargazing will have to be an out of schoolclub time event such as on the weekends
i really would like to learn in this and i know many others want to learn as well but i am not sure if creating lesson plans myself is a good idea
we have an astronomy class in our school so i would like to make this more relaxed and a place to connect with our fascination of the cosmos
our first meeting is next wednesday so i was thinking we could just brainstorm what we wanted to do together
kind of running this on my own right now
anything and everything for advice would be useful
bit worried
thank you
 by the way how do i scare off the astrologer kids
they keep mixing it up
i live in a highly polluted city where it is almost impossible to see any stars
it would be lucky to catch a glimpse of some planets at times
but last night i saw the entire constellation of orion
i spotted something bright and red almost mistook it for an aeroplane
i was thinking it might be mars but mars do not twinkle
so i came near my window and to my surprise saw the constellation of orion
the red star was betelgeuse
it was amazing because i saw this after years
i do not have anyone with interest in astronomy to share this so sharing with this community
callisto is the most densely cratered object in the solar system but why does it have no large craters like the lunar maria areas

hi edit i have no idea why reddit has displayed that picture as the header to this sorry if it confuses
i have a question about meteors
here is what i have looked into i have been googling the various meteor showers and learning about radiants
i learned that meteors that appear to come at you head on directly from the radiant may appear to have no tail and appear slow moving
i also read that there is a type of meteor known as a sporadic which can be difficult to trace to its radiant
i recently saw some footage by pilots which is being claimed as a ufo sighting yeah i know please do not check out just yet
they are slow moving point sources that appear to arc and apparently have a fizz around them
i want to see if it is more likely to be a meteor shower coming head on
the question comes up because it appears to be coming from near merak or in other footage generally from the big dipper and i could not find a known shower with its radiant here after a good bit of googling
this site seemed fairly comprehensive
its happening july to september and i learned that the perseids are active at this time but would generally be tailed meteors with their radiant in perseus
is it possible to get a sporadic perseid meteor that appears separated from its radiant in perseus
is there another meteor shower taking place around this time that could have no tail and appear near the bottom right hand corner of the big dipper
were noradiant or tailless meteors common in 2022 from june to late september visible from japan to the west coast of the us and to the north
i saw that there is the gamma ursa minorids and the ursids which have the right area as their origin but this does not match the time frame of the observations
the author provides a compilation of clips from 1732 in this video there are other clips with times and dates mentioned in there too but this part at least shows the location of the big dipper
at 2230 he shows what i think could be the meteor head on with the sparks he mentions being the tail of the meteor behind the main body mostly obscured
hopefully this is permissible as i am trying to find an astronomical explanation of a sighting
hi everyone
as part of a university project we are designing a 3u cubesat to perform a deorbit demonstration
we are still in the initial phase and for now i am trying to figure out how much time it takes for satellites of this size to passively decay due to aerodynamic drag from leo
i first wanted to do the calculations by hand and then use a software like stk to validate them
i am having a few issues
from here i was trying to use the equation for drdt in excel to calculate the amount of time for the cubesat to decay ie reach an altitude smaller or equal to 180 km
the way i did it was by simply integrating dr with respect to time and then plotting it in excel using the data for the different altitudes density orbital speed orbital period etc
the results i am getting make absolutely no sense and i checked the steps multiple times so i believe it is just that my method is wrong
could anyone suggest what i am doing wrong and what would be a better method to do this
i am not that great with python but i can try to use it if it makes the whole process easier
thanks in advance
thanks to the help here i purchased a 130p heretige
tonight we had the first clear night for a few days and jupiter was just above the moon
saturn off to the left and the houses out back blocked the street lights
saw the rings of saturn small but clear
jupiter and its many moons
and the almost full moon was so bright and clear my eyes felt a little sore
thanks for the advice here everyone it was super helpful
next is a mobile or camera mount and a barlow to try and capture the views
a friend and i are planning on driving out from the city for stargazing tomorrow and are hoping to see the milky way and this is pretty much the only night we will be able to go and do this for quite some time
from the light pollution map the area we are going to is class 3 on the bortle scale
from the clear sky chart we will have clear skies but below average transparency and darkness is listed as limiting magnitude 40 we do not understand astronomy terms too well so would anyone be able to explain how strongly this will effect what we can see
i am currently working on a project that needs to now the space coordinate that the camera for nasa missions are taken in
does anyone have experience and know how to get them
i was looking for a possible video of the observable universes movements estimated to be current time where i could see the general movements of a macro scale
hopefully it would be in video format of the past billion years
i think this could be useful in predicting the location of things we cannot see
i am not looking for something that calculates micro movements just something that calculates them on a grand scale
is something like this even reasonably possible to achive
thank you
looking for a nice deep sky resort in the continental us to spend a few days at next year during the perseid shower
any suggestions

hi i am looking for a redshiftindependent extragalactic distances including the newest data
i know that is popular but the newest version is version 1710 may 2020 when i try to find some newer data to build database like this by myself using this search then i cannot get distance to galaxy
how can i build a database like this
how do astronomers and physicist do their research today
i cannot find something better than ned that give me api
you know there has been on the press a lot lately about how the starlink satellites clutter up space makes images harder to get etc
what if we look at the technology differently
elon has made the ability to launch thousands of sattlites with ease into earth orbit
imagine a constellation of heo telescopes
high powered and optimized to work together to observe the universe on scales far surpassing anything hubble or james web can ever dream of
what would be the technological issues involved in such a heo telescope setup
and how far out there is the idea
i got this idea while doing dishes and i noticed a small black pan with about an inch of water in it was reflecting the sun onto the wall near it
i noticed that even my breathing near it was causing predictable ripples
i am wondering what might happen if larger structures were used spread all over the world
could you illuminate the surface artifically and thus get rid of at least one variable being the intensity and position of the sun
it just seemed disproportionately sensitive to disturbances to me
you could even tell what direction the movement had come from based on the ripple pattern
nasas dart probe managed to change the path of the asteroid dimorphos
have any asteroid path changes ever been detected
it would be one way of indicating extraterrestrial intelligence
perhaps we have just given someone else an indication we are here
extraterrestrial means anything outside of earth
i doubt the moon counts as jts our satellite
but i am sure mercury and venus and the asteroid belt etc are all semantically speaking extraterrestrial
not sure about the sun
this is based on the assumption we are not alone in the universe so this is not an absurd hypothetical nor pseudoscience
i am just wondering about terminology
main point so if we found aliens no matter what they are extraterrestrials
but i am sure most people think aliens only exist or could exist outside of our solar system
and i am sure there is a classification system within seti concerning them
they might have terms for interstellar aliens and intergalactic aliens
so an alien in the milky way would be an interstellar alien civilization
but not quite
i will further elaborate here later
if they exist outside of the milky way they are intergalactic aliens
but what if we found life within our own star system
like let us say they could exist on venus or even mars this includes fossils of extinct aliens even small organisms or a moon of jupiters etc
does seti have a term for them their possibility
such as intrastellar or intrasolar extraterrestrials
or maybe even solar extraterrestrials
also what if we find them on a moon to a planet and nit the planet outside of sols system
does that have a term
obv lunar would not work
but what is the term for anything found on a moon
also i do not think an adjective form of satellite would work either since planets are satellites too and thus would not be descriptive enough
like extrasolar extraterrestrial planetary life and extrasolar extraterrestrial moonlife
what would life on a moon be called
also extrasolar intragalactic life could work for life in another star system
and i assume life on multiple plants within the same stellar system could be based off the name we have given the planet
now when jt comes to civilizations on a particular planet within the milky way i am sure they would have a basic technical term extrasolar and a name based on the specific star and planet
but when jt comes to possible aliens in say andromeda i am sure that would not really be so important quite yet
 this is something i am truly curious about bht obv does not truly matter i suppose
jts just terminology i am wondering about
bht i would like to know if places that look for life that is not on earth have certain terms and if so i would like to know the terms

this article states that the observed gamma ray burst was 20 times closer than the average long gamma ray burst
if that means that it is 120 of the average distance that puts the average distance as 48 billion light years far outside our ability to see anything
i checked the numbers and the red shift of the object was 151 which does equate to 24 billion light years
i just do not get the 20 times closer part
just as the question asks
thanks in advance
i have recently picked up a very peaked interest in all things space and i have been thinking about getting a beginner telescope to see what it feels like to look at some of space firsthand
tonight i impulsively bought a beginner telescope from amazon for a good deal and i have literally never been more excited for anything in my life
i just wanted to share my joy before i head to bed and i cannot wait to be able to post my own photo in this sub
tips and tricks appreciated
i am not sure if this would be the right channel to ask this but i will take a chance
i was reading a comic and it showed a crescent moon foreground with a waning moon further out and to the right in the same image
i am wondering if this is a realistic possibility
it is really bugging me for some reason
the image can be found at it is near the end of the chapter lots of scrolling
sorry
i would have posted the image of the moon but i do not think i am allowed to per the rules
hi fellow astro peeps
i am giving a talk p soon for some public outreach and it is kind of a once a month deal so since it is october i was thinking some spookyhalloween stuff
if anyones knows any funky stories like unknown radio signals or weird observations people took too far thinking aliens
right away those kind of things would be great
especially if i can give a reasonable science explanation of them too
i have already got some skull nebula stuff and dark matter web i was going to pull up and talk about how they have come to look spooky but always can use more suggestions thanks
if there was a planet on the other side of our sun equidistant from the earth the same size also how long would it take for the two planets to collide
could the collision result in a newlarger planet being formed
and could any life survive at all if one was
lastly how often would we have seen said planet
i have done some research on lagrange points to see how i could possibly justify an idea in my book but i am unable to find any information on what could be reasonably possible for it to make much sense and i would like to be relatively accurate with the outcome
do not use your glowing gadgets at star parties
do not shine a huge white flashlight at a telescopers eyes
we know using regular light at night is bad news for astronomy because it ruins the night vision stargazers waited a patient 2030 minutes to build up
that is why to see their star maps and such astronomers instead use little red lights which preserve rather than ruin night vision since the rods on the retina do not really see red
okay great
the above is well understood and settled
but now my question
what about green laser pointers
how do those impact night vision
i have not been able to find anything specifically linking green laser pointers to night vision either way
surely somebody out there in astronomy land must know
do green laser pointers preserve or ruin night vision and why
enlighten us please pun intended
i had a look and could not find anything online except for a transformation to iv jordi et al
2006 and a iv to temperature function ramirez and mendelez 2005 that only works for iv lt 104 my data has multiple values above 3 so that may indicate my data has not been processed correctly is there a way to get either the gi to temperature or the iv to temperature
hi
so i have been debating for a while whether or not to post about this but finally decided to do so since it is something i am kind of passionate about and this subredit seems the closest to the topic matter of the movement of the sun throughout the sky and how it changes based on the latitude of the observer
as i am sure many reading this are already familiar with we have graphs online charting day night and the three stages of twilight inbetween civil nautical and astronomical being when the sun is below the horizon but still close enough to affect the night sky in some way
also if you do not know what i am talking about here is a source you can visit to show you what the graph looks like where you live it got me to thinking though what about tracking the suns position above the horizon
see i work night shift 18300500 and live a little over east of my work so some times throughout the year i get these breathtaking sunrises and sunsets but other times throughout the year are a major nuisance since the sun is about to set or has just risen and as such is very close to the horizon
i drive a narrow 2 lane road 1 lane in each direction so this mildly stresses me out
graphs like the ones i mentioned above are great for telling what time of year i would be getting the breathtaking sunrises and sunsets but lack the ability to visually show me when the sun poses the most of a hazard just before or just after setting 
so it got me thinking 
what would that graph look like if you partitioned degrees of day similar to how you partition stages of twilight in essence extending the graph
obviously it would not really make since to extend the night portion as there is really no differance to the observer when the suns position 20 below the horizon vs 80 below the horizon 
but during the day there is a very noticeable difference between 20 amp 80 above the horizon 
so i set about making some graphs differentiating what i refer to as degrees of day
i decided to divide the sky into 12 parts and made several graphs showcasing this by using different latitudes at the prime meridian to basiclly show how local mean time changes depending on latitude
i thought about adding them in here but am unsure if it would be violating the group rules so for now i will abstain
if anyone is curious though and it is ok i would love to share them
for now i am just curious if anyone has any thoughts on this
or knows of something similar that i have not found
i heard that the data was wrong but what is the new date
gtkic 9832227 is a contact binary whose 11 hr orbital period is rapidly changing
based on the apparent exponential decay of its period the two stars were predicted to merge in early 2022 resulting in a rare red nova outburst
fortunately kic 9832227 was observed in 2003 as part of the nasa ames prekepler vulcan project to search for transiting exoplanets
we find that the vulcan timing measurement does not agree with the previous exponential decay model
this led us to reevaluate the other early epoch nonkepler data sets the northern sky variability survey nsvs and wide angle search for planets wasp survey
we find that the wasp times are in good agreement with the previous prediction but the nsvs eclipse time differs by nearly an hour
the very large disagreement of the vulcan and nsvs eclipse times with an exponentially decaying model forces us to reject the merger hypothesis
although period variations are common in contact binaries the physical because of the period changes in kic 9832227 remains unexplained a third star scenario is unlikely
this study shows the data collected by the vulcan photometer to be extremely valuable for extending the baseline for measurements of variable stars in the kepler field

tldr do not let the city lights discourage you
if you have an interest in space and astronomy pick up a pair of binoculars and start looking
you will be surprised at how much you can see even with all the light pollution around you
ampx200b i live in a bright downtown area
like very downtown
think skyscrapers and neon signs everywhere
over the years i had heard so many people complain about city lights and light pollution and how we have lost the night sky and all that depressing stuff both in person and on the internet that i never bothered to find or identify things in the sky
i never even looked at the sky much
in july 2022 the first jwst images just happened to drop on the same day as amazons prime day and i impulse bought a pair of 20x80 astronomy binoculars on sale and a tripod
i went in completely blind about how to find things in the sky
i am learning as i go with the stellarium app
ampx200b mostly looking south east and above from my rooftop there is taller buildings and way more light pollution towards n and w and off the top of my head here is all the things i have seen and learned in the last 3 months incredible detail on the moon
the craters cast shadows and that shows even more detail especially along the edge between light and dark
there is something new to see every night as the moon goes through its phases and there are shadows in new places
 jupiter and its four biggest moons
it looks like a big bright disk
the moons are dots along a roughly straight line and they change positions every night
jupiter happened to be at opposition last month
 saturn also at opposition a month earlier
it also looks like a bright disk but much smaller
it looks yellowish
the rings look like bulges
it is clearly not circular
titan is also visible
it also changes location over days
 mars started as a bright point clearly redorangeish but has since grown into a small disk and i am looking forward to opposition in december when it will be bigger
 uranus and neptune both points
uranus looks slightly pale blueish
 the pleiadas
they are clearly blue and i can see 50 stars in there
 core of the andromeda galaxy
it looks like a fuzzy white oval patch
 hyades mirfaks surroundings double cluster in perseus and many other dense spots in the sky i see all the time but do not know the names of yet
 many many double stars
many many stars everywhere in general
blue and yellow ones stand out
if a star is shown on the stellarium app all zoomed in at max zoom at free tier i can see it in the binoculars
using the app i have learned how to find constellations like cassiopeia andromeda aries perseus and cygnus in the sky
under these conditions many constellations have missing stars and many are completely invisible to the naked eye
so i also got a 8x42 roof for finding them
surprisingly these show me faint objects like the andromeda galaxy as well just much less zoomed in
things that are not visible the milky way triangulum galaxy any nebula any other cloudy m or ngc objects any colors except on bright planets and stars
ampx200b if i can see all of the things above from the middle of a very bright downtown area in only 3 months and looking only south and east imagine how much more you can see from where you are in one year
do not let the city lights discourage you
if you have an interest in space and astronomy pick up a pair of binoculars and start looking
hello astronomy community
i know starlink and the forthcoming mega constellations have caused harm and hampered observations in a large way but i am wondering if there might be a possible unintended use for the ground stations has anyone investigated if you could use the ground stations dishes from these mega constellations starlink and possibly similar ones in the future that are equipped with phased array antennas to build something that might be equivalent to the vlba very long baseline array just with far more observatories
it seems like the signal filtering and antiinterference capabilities of these units are first class
the amount of geography covered is basically the face of the earth
all units have good time synchronization built in gps for self reporting of position and orientation and the ability to phone the data back home relatively quickly
it appears the radios are 10 ghz so i am not sure on the scientific usefulness for the spectrums that they would be able to monitor
thank you for your time this post was originally inspired by this one over in rstarlink
today in my physics class my teacher was demonstrating the effects of a vacuum on various objects
as i was watching a question came to mind
i saw the tube that the air was being pumped out of and the fact that there was a vacuum inside made sense
the tube caused the air from the outside to stay outside
i asked him what encapsulates the vacuum of outer space he did not have an answer for me and so i ran here
what encapsulates the vacuum of outer space
if something does encapsulate spaces vacuum then how is the negative pressure of the vacuum not enough that the capsule collapses in on itself
not sure what the website is called stumbled onto it last year while browsing but it had an interface where a ton of satellite images of stars nebula galaxies etc
were stitched together onto a sphere and you could zoom in to ridiculous resolutions here is a screenshot i had of it if it helps
does any of this ring a bell

my partner and i are currently on maui facing southwest and are near haikupauwela area
we have been star gazing several nights around 9pm11pm hawaiian time and witnessed a static bright blinking light that looks to be something akin to a star
it does not move in the night sky
it also does not blink in any kind of pattern either
we have watched it for over 2 hours over several nights
it looks to be somewhere around the area in the attached photo roughly along the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by iota capricorni 29 capricorni and 18 aquari this is how they are referenced in the stellarium app
what could we be looking at
for the 2024 total eclipse i will be right in the middle of the path of totality
do not have to step out my backyard
and the weather where i live during april is pretty guarenteed for a cloudless day
cannot freaking wait
i would like to see andromeda collide with the milky way on vr from a cornfield or some other earthly loaction
is there any vr simulation of the night sky as it will change in the future
just out of curiosity since i could not find much online how much would the number of meteors per hour diminish a few days after the peak
checking out the geminids meteor shower but scheduling conflicts will not let me get out anywhere good until the 17th
thanks in advance
what do you want in an online website startup general discussion i m a 16yearold web developer astronomy lover and would love to hear your unique ideas and what do you look for in a website as an astronomy lover
 first i do think processed images of things like the pillars of creation are cool given how far away they are and the data we can extract from them
however i am genuinely curious as to what is the point of producing said images and saying here is new photos the jwst picked up
these cool looking processed images of deep space objects such as the pillars of creation would look nothing like that to the naked eye correct
it just seems extremely disingenuous that we are being fed that these are images in the first place
its like if i were to take a professional picture of my car but photoshop to change the color and say this is a picture of my car
then when you come and see it you would say that is nothing like the pictures
i have a 120 zwo asi a 150750 newtonian reflector on azimuth mount and a laptop
i do not have time ordering a cable until the solar eclpse so my question is this
there are two zwo asi cables right
one of them connects the mount to the laptop
does that cable also charge one from another
so if i charge my laptop constantly and connect it to the mount woth the az goto i have set up will the mount be powered until the partial eclipse or not
say you have safe solar glasses for how long can you look at the solar eclipse
is there any recommended duration
i am visiting relatives in wisconsin and around 400pm cdt one of us saw a dot in the sky
at first we assumed highaltitude airplane but then it became apparent it was not really moving much
we watched it for about 30 minutes
i got out an app on my phone and the best i could tell it was in the area where vega would be
is it possible to see vega on a very sunny day very light cirrus clouds in the midtolate afternoon
sunset is at about 610 local today
we did get out some binoculars
it did not exactly look round but there is probably some atmospheric interference
i would estimate it was at 7080 degrees above the horizon when facing pretty close to due east
for those curious why we were looking straight up in the sky they live by a skydiving schoolwe were watching the jumpers coming out of the plane
i was reading different things about this
some saying that there will be no spectacular outbursts and some otherwise
i was also wondering if i could somehow tell if there will be a green glowing meteor and if it has a legitimate name
thanks
so i have done some google search but i still do not understand it
i am well aware of the concept of redshifting and blueshifting but i do not get why because of expansion of universe which causes redshifting of photons we cannot see things beyond the horizon because in my understanding of things since nothing can travel faster than light than even if a galaxy or something in the universe is extremely far away and the universe is constantly expanding which causes redshifting and that causes the transmitted light to stretch it should still reach us eventually even if took really long
was testing out my new binoculars looking at the orion nebula when i saw a short maybe one or two seconds very bright flash between sirius moving towards orion this morning october 24th about 632 am i looked on heavens above but did not see anything that fit
is anyone have any suggestions about what i might have seen or where i might research it
thank you
as a christmas gift i am pulling together a calendar for my sister with one picturemonth for each of the 12 letters of her name
i have got a lovely picture of rigel for my first r thanks to nasa but am struggling to come up with a second r for the one remaining entry
i have toyed with romulus regulus reticulum and risa but calendarworthy picturesillustrations have been hard to come by
i am not limiting it to starsplanetsmoons so beautiful hires pictures of r galaxies comets constellations or even nasa missions eg
europa clipper dart parker solar probe are also options
push come to shove i might fall back to rocket or rover there are some fine images of them but those feel more like a stretch compared to others
so i am hoping rastronomy can help me fill the missing gap in my calendar with other r ideas even better with links to free highres images a la nasa
thanks
hey rastronomy
 i could really use some help
i am a middle school math teacher in nyc and i am trying to plan a community astronomy night for my schools studentsfamilies for later this year likely may or june
i am very new to astronomyastroimaging and i know very little about how to start
i do have experience with computer programming and college level mathematics calculus linear algebra differential equations etc however i have no clue what sort of equipment would be needed to facilitate viewing space in the middle of nyc

i had recently started my college classes and one of them is astronomy
i am very excited to learn about the topic as i always had an interest pertaining to the sky and the stars
however onto the main point my professor wants us to share information in the discussion posts on any upcoming sky events eg meteor showers comets and asteroids
are there any websites out there where i can keep up with such events
i am based in yous

i have a couple of slightly random questions about star magnitudes
i am trying to write instructions for the pattern i am making where i am doing one star style for stars of magnitude 2029 and another for stars of mag 19 or below
is there a way to describe 0 magnitude stars
i am used to hearing about 1st magnitude and 2nd magnitude but i do not know what the brightest are called 0th magnitude does not sound right
is there an official name
and also am i right that something of mag say 125 is a 1st magnitude star
i thought it was but then occurred to me it could be like centuries in which case 125 would be 2nd magnitude
thank you for help d
so i have a star app that rates leonids meteor shower strong and monocerotids meteor shower weak
it also says that the latter has a higher zhr
could someone explain the the rating
me and my friend are trying to figure out which we want to photograph although the moon will be out at leonids
i know clockwise does not have any meaning in space but i am curious
thanks
sorry if this has been asked but when i search it up i get different answers
i want to know if the eclipse will be visible at the east coast of the usa and what time will it start to happen

in places like fairbanks alaska tromsk norway etc i have see that the sun does not set from like may to julyetc
but can they see the moon that entire time
does it still go through the same cycles or does their positioning on the earth mess up their perspective
ampx200b i did look it up and google says the moon would be upside if i swapped hemispheres but cannot find info on if i was in the extreme north ps
are there any big telescopes up there seems like a prime location right
hello everyone i did some extensive googlefu and i cannot exactly find the type of astronomy software i need
i have two requirements 1 to have the ability to go backwards and forwards in time to see the positions of stars from the surface of the earth
would be great to have a 10000 year scope in either direction if possible
2 the ability to move to a particular point in our galaxy ie sirius any star etc and observe from that location to see the vantage point of everything
i did read the rules and i think this post is allowed i have used redshift 5 software ages ago but i am assuming we have something more advanced now
thank you
i have a celestron solar filter for my nexstar 8se
is it safe to use this solar filter to look at the sun through my naked eyes
i have done this a few times and it seems fine
however i want to allow my students to observe the sun through the filter with their naked eyes
is this safe
i am 9999 sure it is safe barring any holes in the filter or students doing something dumb but i do want to run it past more experienced astronomers first
eratosthenes measured the earth sometime around 200 because with two poles
these poles were a significant distance apart
how did he check the shadow on each pole and make his calculation since he could not check them himself at the same time
obviously he could not have called his friend stationed at the other pole to ask him to mark where the shadow fell
what was his method
it was sometime between 1130 and 1150 eastern time
i was in new jersey and facing southwest when i happened to see what looked like a meteor
however i was not in low lighting and it was similar in brightness to one of the brightest stars i could see so i am wondering if it is too bright to be a meteor
i did read though that the southern and northern taurids produce a lot of fireballs and are currently active
could it be from those
so when planets orbit around a star its called a star system or solar system
what is it called when planets or any mass orbit around anything else but a star
edit got my answer for a broader term planetary system
according to the i am going to 2022 meteor shower calendar am going tonetfilesmeteorshowercal2022pdf the best time to see the leonids this year is either around 11pm on november 17 the nodal maximum or just before sunrise on november 19 the 1733 dust trail
it seems like the 17th is more reliable but the 19th has the possibility of being much more numerousvivid
any experienced meteor watchers have a recommendation for which date to plan for
i am going to spain soon and plan to find a plave with little to no light pollution to hopefully see some cool things
i have checked a light pollution map and are planning to bring comfortable chairs
i was wondering if anyone have some tips or tricks for this to be a success
we are considering bringing binoculars
thanks
if a neutron star becomes dense enough that light cannot escape why does that also imply that the size of the newly formed black hole singularity is infinitely small
cannot the remaining matter maintain a similar radius even though we can no longer see it
perhaps this is a stupid question after all i am not a physicist
but here goes
is it possible that microscopic black holes formed during the early universe due to protons slamming into each other and if so could these microscopic black holes eventually gobble up other particles and grow to be massive
is there anything besides galaxies
i have read how henrietta leavitt determined that the period of oscillations of cepheid variable stars are related to the stars luminosity and that this can be and is used to determine their distance from earth
the true luminosity is derived from the period and then compared to the apparent observed luminosity to derive the stars distance
i have several questions in my mind every time i hear or read about this
1 was in not necessary to measure the distances to these cepheid stars in some other way in order to confirm andor calibrate this theory
2 if 1 is true how was that done back in the early 1900s
parallax
i thought stars are too far away to use parallax even if observations are done 6 months apart so as to use the diameter of earths obit around the sun as the triangular base
are some cepheid variables close enough to use parallax even with early 1900s tech
3 when edwin hubble used cepheid variable stars to estimate the distance from earth to the andromeda nebula as it was called prior how could hubble know that said cepheid variable stars were actually within andromeda and not between earth and andromeda or behind andromeda perhaps by many light years
in other words how could hubble be sure that from the line of sight from earth to andromeda that these cepheid stars did not just appear to be within andromeda
4 how was luminosity of stars measured in henrietta leavitts day
apparent luminosity or otherwise
eyeball estimates
photographic plates
i would imagine the latter but how was that quantified back then when there were no ccd sensors
hello fellow astronomers
currently selfstudying astronomy at gcse level was wondering if anyone else has done it or is doing it and what tips they could give
i do realize that you will not see much when you look at the exact location of the galactic centre but what is the best way to locate it relative to a bright star
i am aware that gamma2 sagittarii alnasl is the closest easily visible nakedeye star to that location in the night sky but how would you use it to look for the location
hello
i have been making this website that let us you see all the asteroids that will be approaching earth on the current day and the day after that tomorrow

feel free to check it out at ampx200b
hello fellow learners i am a data enthusiast currently working on data from james webb telescope
i generally work on gcp and thought it would be fun if anyone wants to work together remotely of course
dm me if interested and have a background in astronomycosmology
everything i research in regards to the primary reason for the temperature difference in the season centers around the tilt of the earth in its axis
if the tilt favors a certain hemisphere to be closer to the sun that hemisphere will experience warmer temperatures
but if the earth travels in an elliptical path would not the times when it is closest to the sun be the warmest
it seems that difference in the earths proximity to the sun based off the orbital path is at a much higher magnitude than the tilt of its axis
all the articles i have pulled up online kind of gloss over this and goes straight to the axis
hi folks so this is a question which i hope can lead to some chatter and hopefully it is not against the rules but i do some amateur astrophotography and i get all manner of nebular gaseous regions hii etc but i am looking for a break down of the gases and their colors and what the colors mean
so we see a lot of blue think around plelaides and i have seen the term dust thrown around
but i have not got anything deep thatn thatso what is cosmic dust made of
what elements because it the blue coloring
is red always hii
basically if anyone has a color break down of what colors mean what and what dust is really i would appreciate it
did he just think some stars wiggled
i am confused and concerned
is there something i am missing lol
i have tried looking for layman explanations for it but am having trouble
i understand the universe began expanding 14 bya
i understand that at first the expansion was extreme
20k ly across in the space of a second or something like that
i understand the universe is still expanding and the expansion is accelerating
the question i have comes from this at one point the acceleration slowed
why
i have been trying to find layman theories as to why
i do not pretend to understand a lot about astronomy
i groom dogs
but my job allows me to zone out quite a bit and listenwatch astronomy stuff
as well as other topics
i have just been wondering about that for a bit thanks in advance
i hope i do not come across as a complete idiot but who knows
i have a couple of other questions like do we really understand if time worked the same way in the infant universe knowing what we understand about relativity and black holes and the like
and what will happen to black holes in the heat death of the universe but i am hoping to start with this one and maybe go other places with it
i have been trying to google this for a while at this point and cannot seem to find it
i am probably not even using the right terminology
dear community please help me out
what are the planets called that have identical rotation and orbiting periods
ie
one half constantly facing the star and the other half being in constant darkness
also what would be the weather like on such a planet in the belt region
i know i read somewhere that after the atmosphere balances itself there would not be violent wind blowing anymore is this accurate
forgive my ignorance 
we observe the speed of stars on exogalactic regions as maintaining a constant orbital speed around the galactic nuclei black hole no matter the distance from center or not
but we see in our own observable solar system the specific mechanical energy and specific angular momentum where the speed of the body is directly proportional to distance from the gravitational anchor
i know this is the premise of dark energymass but what does not it apply to our own celestial bodies
why does not mercury and uranus orbit around our sun a the same rate due to dark energymass
anyone have a picture of the pillars of creation using a 8 inch dobsonian that is processed and stacked
since i am getting the telescope i am wondering what i should expect
so the lunar eclipse on november 8th
google says it peaks at 6am so does this mean i should stay up monday night leading into tuesday at 6 am or is it during tuesday night
my house is surrounded by trees and i would love to have a vantage point on my property where i can see a wider view of the sky and do some astrophotography potentially
is it feasible to do astrophotography from a deck built onto the roof of a house
if that would always have too much vibration has anyone heard of having a pedestal that is like 3050 feet tall like an anchored steel tube or would it always be too shaky too
this is more a question of curiosity and it might just be a nonstarter
any input is appreciated
2150 est in the western sky in us saw a blue and green flash much like a shooting star but seemed at least 10 times as big
there is some cloud coverage at the moment enough to consider it not to be a shooting star while also wondering if the light from it may have undergone atmospheric coloring andor refraction
read yeaterday that a chinese rocket booster fell into the pacific ocean
so just more debris possibly
anyone else see anything
any ideas
i was looking up information on the uranus moon sycorax on google when i came across its mean diameter information
it reads 15723 15 km 16536 42 km
my basic understanding is the following mean diameter is the diameter measured at right angles to each other
157 must be minimum kms 23 km to the max diameter in one orientation against 165 minimum kms 36 km to the max diameter at the right angles to it such as vertical vs horizontal or vice versa
q1
is it a correct understanding
q2
what are those xx km figures
new to this sub but figured this would be a good place to ask
i love finding things in the night sky and there are some fun apps for phones that track where you are pointing but i would love a nice 2d print
there is always the classic star chart with two circles but as a fan of maps xkcdcom977 i am not really into that projection
i would love something analogous to a waterman butterfly or better yet the epicycloidal thoughts
i am tempted to download a database and plot my own but that seems like a lot of work so if anyone wants to play around with that let me know
i have read several articles over the last few years wherein astronomers of various stripes bemoan the reflected light coming from starlink satellites they often do not complain about any other satellites
they use terms like existential threat and catastrophe among other hyperbolic comments to suggest the consequences of these motion artifacts are insurmountable except to stop the launch of future starlink satellites
as a lover of astronomy science and photography i am struck by the lack of creativity regarding the potential solutions to this problem
the easiest one that comes to my mind is simply filtering moving objects from the resulting image
as i understand the process of image data acquisition of professional and amateur telescopes alike they acquire their images over time either as a single long tracked exposure or as an aligned stack of multiple images
software in use today removes these types of artifact the streaks of orbiting satellites are subtracted from the static background
moreover even if current software is inadequate for this task one could envision new software that would be fully up to the task
knowing that filtration options are available why are these heady organizations who operate telescopes complaining about what to me seems to be a readily solvable problem
thanks for your insights
so i have the celestron starsense explorer lt 114az with the smartphone app starsense
when i use it acts like it is inverted so the app show me the opposite side of the universe which the does not let me find what i want to see through the telescope
is there something in the app that i am missing
please help
i often hear it described as a question mark either normal position or upside down and i definitely agree
but whenever i see it my first impression is of a bust or statue of a human head neck and shoulders
what say ye
i heard recently that quantum computers can exchange information anywhere in the universe due to quantum entanglement
i have no idea how any of that works or if it is even true but could this be used for communication with aliens
i am assuming that we could somehow coordinate which particles get entangled and if so there has to be some sort of molecular schelling point
i am turning to reddit because i have searched this up and i cannot find anything about it
given that i am assuming i am wrong or missing something
i was thinking it would be impossible to assign a schelling point to a specific molecule out of millions but i also do not know if that is how it would need to work
please let me know if any of you have any insight on this regarding quantum computers or the idea of a molecular schelling point
saw two streaks tonight
the second was green and orange multiple times as it streaked across
after it burned away there was still a plasma trail about 5 seconds afterwards
anyone else seeing them
hi i have recently got an interest in astronomy and the cosmic calendar but i noticed that when i look for it on google most of the articles and other pages that explain it they only emphatize on certain months but there is very little information about april i would like to know because wikipedia only says that the first nebulae were formed without specifying much
i would love to know what happened in this month or anybody that could please lead me to a source where i can read about this further any of them would be great
i really need help because i looked on a lot of websites and still cannot find it
i did not i was not even born yet
born in 1995
why are large telescopes often housed in domes
as per the title why are the majority of large telescopes housed in domes where the dome rotates with the telescope
is there an advantage to the large structure and empty space surrounding the relatively small telescope
if the telescope only needs rotate 360 on a base and elevate between 0 and 90 deg surly a more compact structure that moves with the telescope would suffice
sorry for my ignorance i am only a mechanical engineer with a casual interest in space
reposted to include i have researched this as a mechanical engineer and only find information regarding to the design of domes and how to build them
there is little to no information as to why a dome not any other shape
november 9 at about 4 am i saw two objects moving across the sky west to east over the east side of rocky mountain national park think estes park colorado
they looked like stars same size and brightness but moved at a steady pace and covered the entire sky in less than 10 minutes
i would have thought they were airplanes but they did not move steadily
they moved somewhat jerkily but continued in an arc across the sky
could they have been satellites
they were moving slower than any meteors i have seen and seemed to have definite paths
i am an astronomy student and have not been to school in 8 years
after 3 exams i am starting to fear that i am not smart enough for stem
my classmates own telescopes and their parents have prior knowledge i cannot even afford a telescope
i do not know what to do to raise my confidence this semester
i do not want to quit i just want to feel like i am good at something
say you are standing on a planet inside a nebula the california nebula for instance and you look into the night sky would you be able to perceive that you are in it
would the sky have an orangish tint or some cloudy texture or is it a bit more like fog when you cannot see it close to yourself but can at a distance
would it even be bright enough to see or would it be super faint like when we look toward the galactic core
i am guessing since all the filters we use to see them boost and change the color once you got close enough to any nebula it would not be visible at all
i read the rules all of them i promise and think this should be okayi am not trying to sell this just need some help from the rastronomy community

review request
 hi
this is my first ever post on here so forgive my current lack of lingo etc long time listener first time caller situation i wanted to put this out to the astronomy community and get honest feedback
in 2016 my friend nathan and i wrote a book together
for background he is an phd and astrophysicist with a big brain for the universe and i am a comedian and writer
together we wrote a new version of the night sky based on southern culture and folklore
the entire approach to stargazing was rewritten and honestly it makes looking up at night easy for anyone and fun
we mapped entirely new constellations over the course of a year plus
new asterisms followed that mapping and the stories that put them there
out with the greek stuff and in with the dipcup you all stuff
once that was done we then had to create new astrology to meet the needs of the new southern version of stars in the sky
i will be happy to send a free copy link to anyone that wants to review it for meus
i am planning an expansion of this ip and new world we created but would like more opinions of the current work before growingaltering what comes next
the overview of the book is here there are few screen grabs so you can see some of what we did
would love anyones thoughts
thank you
 i am going to be making a very quick diy telescope as a demonstration next thursday and so i am ordering some supplies for it now
the plan is to create a simple refractor telescope out of two pvc pipes that slide in and out of each other to focus the telescope
the eyepiece lens will be a regular 25mm eyepiece lens from amazon
as for the objective lens i was hoping to find a double convex lens with a diameter of 50mm and a focal length of 500mm
however due to time constraints i am finding it difficult to find one available for delivery soon enough
i have found one with a 100mm focal length would that be too short to create a telescope with
would it result in a really short telescope more like a monocular
and if so is it possible to make one with multiple lenses
thanks for any help 
so if two atoms collide one of the products might be light but if light is made of photons how do they come to be
are they there already and the collision lits them
do different elements of the atoms fuse together and form them
a pulsar has a strong magnetic field which focuses radiation into a beam which appears to pulse as the rotation of the pulsar sweeps this beam across space intersecting earth from hundreds or thousands of light years away
but how bright and powerful is this beam
if a pulsar were the distance of the sun and the beam were directed at earth would it melt the earth or what
or are all these beautiful images long exposur images that have been touched up afterward
i want to know what your eye sees
can anyone show me
if you can drop the name of your telescope too that would be much appreciated
pretty straight forward question from a new person in astronomy
last friday even with a few extra layers of clothes the cold was extremely demoralizing and after stepping in for a hot drink i ended up staying inside only to go out again a few hours later to collect the gear
and it was not even a specially low temperatures night
so i am thinking of making a club and applying for funding for some equipment mainly astrophotography rig and an 8 dob for planetary but i am not quite sure what i could do in this club and i need ideas before i present the program to school any ideas
because the explanation of water on earth does not quite explain why or how earth had the room for it because it does not seem like other terrestrial planets also have a terrain that look like it could hold oceans as deep as our own this is a genuine question from a student not speculation
are there no nearby galaxies facing us head on
seems like we should have been able to get an image of a supermassive ages ago based on the incredible images people can get with a few thousand dollars of equipment these days
my dream would be able to work under satellite communication like directing spacecraft retrieving info from them and images analyzing them etc
i am not sure the exact name of this field
so above is a question i have pondered about recently as i am an aspiring science fiction writer with a passion for astonomy and exoplanets
so anyway we know of only two main states a planetary object can be in while in orbit tidally locked like the moon is to earth and not tidally locked like the planets are to the sun
but is it possible for a planetary body to be psudo tidally locked
basically its a state in between these two extremes where say a moon for example has a odd orbit around its planet that while at times make it locked into one spot for some time but due to the influence of another moon nearby gets nudged so that the moon begins to get tidally unlocked at least for a short period
like perhaps its due to another moon of simular size and gravity and its gravitational influcence rubs off on its neighbor
i know we have yet to encounter such a odd phenominon but is such a thing even remotely possible
note this is just specculation on my part but would love to hear your thoughts i will aslo ask this on other subreddits if you feel this is inapproprite
there are 4 known categories of black holes in the universe miniature stellar mass intermediate and supermassive
for this discussion let us pick out stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes
as we know slipping past the event horizon of a black hole means an object light too is at a point of no return and subject to the tidal effect caused by a black holes immense gravitational force the said object will be spaghettified
that being said i always felt that it is the smaller black holes that are far more dangerous
their event horizons are smaller and by virtue of their size they are also immensely dense simple math
with supermassive black holes the event horizons are massive and thus it is also more likely that one could stay there for longer than they could on the event horizons of much smaller black holes
however i recently read an article that explains very precisely why this is the case
it is due to the tidal force exerted by a given black hole
the difference in the force exerted on ones head and the force exerted on ones feet will be much larger in smaller black holes than they are in larger ones
and as i mentioned already that spaghettification depends on the tidal effect you will get much more spaghettified by a smaller black hole
just sharing something that i have found to be really fascinating ever since i started majoring in astrophysics 4 years ago
i am collecting examples regarding this topic
i am particularly interested in those who have coincided with particular events in human history and perhaps even influenced it in some way
maybe it is not very important but a fun thing i learned is that both mark twains birth and death saw the halleys comet return
do you have any reading recommendations ideas events that should absolutely be on this list for me
hi everyone my first m31 image l was shot january 4th 2022 in jalisco mx and my most recent m31 photography r was november 12 2022 in zacatecas mx
both images were shot using a sony a7siii with a sony 200600mm lens at 600mm f63 i used the sky adventurer pro as a star tracker
however my question is why does it seem that some stars and galaxies like m110 have changed position
is it because they orbit m31
i will leave my photograph process below l this image is only one image no stacks and a 30 second exposure with 1600 iso r this image is 1075 stacked images of 3 second exposures at 16000iso yeah i know a lot lol with 100flat frames 50 darks and 75 bias frames
stacked with astap on mac and colored and processed in photoshop
so it was about a year ago there was a picture going around that showed the earth in orbit around the sun
the picture had the earth twice one for winter and one for summer and showed apx
distances
the caption on the picture stated something like you are telling me that little bit of distance difference is enough to change temperatures for seasons
yeah i know i replied kindly its about the amount of daylight and nothing to do with distance
not sure where these people keep coming from
anyway
it is now relative again and cannot find it anywhere
i am having a go at some image processing and i have hit a wall
i want to compare and apply spectral weights to images taken with different filters but i cannot figure out whether i should be factoring in the specific filter responses
the units in the files are mjysr janskys have a hz component but filters are specified in wavelength
now i have convinced myself that since we have units the data must have gone through photometric calibration and represents real world radiance hence exposure should be a nonissue but the per hz part of the units makes me unsure whether i need to do any relative scaling of pixel values between different bandwidth filters
in other words is the pixel value ment to mean xbw and be scaled by the integral of throughput or is it already scaled and then i have no idea why it is in spectral units
i am really only interested in being able to sum values from multiple filter bands and be sure that filter bandwidth and throughput is properly taken care of
using l3 products
i have searched the documentation and could not find an answer
thanks in advance
hi all i am trying to track down a list of past full moon dates to help me work out when a certain event occurred in my childhood but googling full moon in australia dates in the past just gives me lots of results about upcoming full moons
where would i find the dates of past full moons
i recently purchased a 2nd hand 76700mm telescope i know its a very low size it was cheap including a cool dobsonian mount and a solar filter and lots of eyepieces
just hours ago after days of clouds and fog i had a brief timewindow to see jupiter and saturn
and oh boy what a view it was
at only 28x i could already make out the red bands on jupiter and at 70x magnification with the 10mm eyepiece gave me the best view of these unfathomably huge colored clouds hundres of millions of miles away incromphensible
later i looked at saturn at 70x and wow it was so clear to see the gap between the rings and saturn making the rings and the planet able to be see as their are distinctive objects
its color is also very apparent as it is more uniformly colored
all in all i am amazed at the power of the small aperture to be able to make out details on the 2 planets let us see what the sun can offer sunspots hopefully
hi yall i used to live on the western slope of colorado and seriously considering to return there and live out retirement
i love the area the clear and dark skies and the outdoors nearby
i read somewhere that the ideal astronomical observing altitude is between 5000 to 8000 ft so the west slope would be perfect
i lived there over 20 years ago so perhaps the weather conditions and night sky have become more polluted
i would like to build a backyard observatory
is the west slope still good
hi all we are a young couple who are just getting into astronomy recently bought the first telescope
it would be amazing to find a community in the paris area to join and learn from
any ideas are welcome
i have been trying to find the answer to this using google but i cannot seem to word it right to find an answer
summer and winter the earth is on the opposite side of the sun
how come the sun continues to be at it is highest point around 12pm no matter the season
why does not the time the sun reaches it is highest point cycle between afternoon and midnight
one side of the sun at 12pm the sun is at it is highest point when it is on the other side should not whatever time zone you are in be facing away from the sun at 12pm
hi i am a high school student who is doing some reserach on meteors i am trying to find velocities of the meteors when they entered earth the intial mass and the final mass
i have trying for a 2 days can someone please help me
hello
i would like to give my astronomy students a project where they research light pollution and how to make changes around town to reduce our local light pollution so that community members can see more of the night sky
would anyone here happen to already have something like this or maybe even know where i might find something like this online
do not mind buying something like this off of teachers pay teachers
edit apparently i do not have enough comment karma for auto mod to allow me to respond to comments on my post
i am in arkansas usa for those that have asked
i am really looking for a project around this idea that is already setup
something that has instructions and a rubric for the research project that i would be able to use with my students
as a kid i used to always be watching videos and stuff about physics and astronomy and i did well in it in high school
i really wanted to he an astrophysicist as a kid but my parents sat me down one night and told me i was too stupid to do it and so i gave up on that dream long ago
now i am an animation major in college but i am about to fail the first basic astronomy class for the second time now and all i can say is that astronomy has now become one of my least favorite subjects
i cannot seem to wrap my brain around the math and i am routinely struggling with the material
i am almost willing to try tutoring but i feel like tutoring is cheating and it just means i am too stupid to understand the material
i do not know what to do
i have not taken any math or physics in 5 years so every time someone whips out almost any math i am really really lost
i do not remember any geographytrig
i only took precalc in high school but i sucked at that and now i suck at this
i hate the fact that my experience with the subject has caused me to hate something i used to love
i need academic resources or something because i am failing to understand how to do hubbles law and standard candles still makes no sense after 3 youtube videos and listening in class and looking at the textbook
help
edit wow i was not expecting this much support i really appreciate all of you guys that took the time to read and respond
that said i am definitely going to go get some tutoring today if i can
i never really used a tutor before because it felt like it meant i was not good enough but i can see now that is an unhealthy mindset
i have been in a really bad place mentally this semester and struggling with this class has really messed with my self esteem
i really do not want to lose my love for space so i am glad to see so many ideas for other ways to pursue that hobby without having to get a masters degree
thanks again for the support you guys 
i just got a gigantic reflector telescope and i have no idea how to collimate it
i have had refractors before but this is my first reflector
i do not have any tools so i am probably going to make a collimating cap but i cannot find how to do it anywhereor atleast in simpler terms could someone help me and explain it to me like i am 5 please
i have been doing some research on the tf relation but i cannot find a solid quantitative equation that gives a galaxys luminosity from its rotational velocity
i looked through the original paper and some other ones but they do not really specify any solid equation
does one even exist and if so what is it
billions of years from now when the earth is consumed by the sun what will happen to the gas giants
i would imagine the change in gravity mass temperature of the sun would radically alter the composition of the outter planets
what about the frozen ice satellites around jupiter
would they potentially become more habitable

hello everyone the picture of andromeda m31 below is my first astro photograph taken eleven months ago with a skywatcher heq5 william optics zenithstar 61 nikon d5600 iso 400 no filter and 25 hours integration staked in deep sky stacker and edited with gimp
i hope you like the picture
i have more on instagram astrobarnacle
ampx200b research study invite night sky connection i am also an academic researcher at the university of derby uk and am advertising a study about how people feel towards the night sky amp whether they feel a connection to it
the study involves completing a brief survey and takes 1012 minutes to complete once you have provided consent
some people may want to take slightly longer
anyone can take part no matter where you are in the world or how often you look at the night sky
taking part is voluntary and there is of course no pressure if you would prefer not to
if this sounds interesting to you then the survey link is here or you can also find the link on my twitter profile drchrisbarnes
many thanks chris
i know that this may break the simple questions rule but i have been trying to find a source on the number of sunspots recorded in any given year for almost an hour and found nothing
i was wondering if any of you knew a place to find good sunspot data
edit resolved in comments
i have been trying to find one but i could not
i hope that herr i can find

i know that all of the awesome colorful pics of it have insanely high exposure so can anyone show a pic of the milky way as how someone in a lightless environment would see it
hello friends some years ago a teacher showed me a website that shows a live animation of all satellites orbiting the earth
it was really cool because you could see the different heights in which the different kind of satellites orbited the earth
does anyone know the name of the website or another similar website
would be really cool
i am looking for a free reliable and frequentlyupdated source for data about objects in the sky such as stars planets comets asteroids satellites etc
preferably in geocentric format or otherwise convertible to geocentric
it can be api that requires registration as long as it does not require business identity and allows at least one fetch of all data every day

i am currently in the process of writing a strategy pc game on which you are an alien sentient computer system out exploring the galaxy very simular to a von neumann probe
a lot of hijinks ensues
so my question is
an alien would not be using our names for stars
they would be using something else
here on earth our star names are mix of good unique names like sirius and for the most part a less exciting hodgepodge of stars named after whoever discovered them like gliese 877boring
so if i am a player playing this game as an exploring probe i should be allowed to choose my own names for everything
until i arrive and see if anything is worth naming every star needs some kind of designation
so if you were a highly organized alien species looking up at your night sky on a planet orbiting sirius how would you go about naming and cataloging the celestial bodies
an idea i have been kicking around is to give each star a numerical name somehow created by the declinationright acension followed by group star number planet number and moon numberfor example 00000000131 means i am on the home star the sun it is the primary star in the system because some decra calculations of closely grouped stars are the same third planet from the star earth primary moon orbiting that planet the moon
it is both a name and a stellar address all in one
anyone have any ideas on how i can improve upon that
as i was taking my dog for a walk tonight 1119 around 815pm est md i noticed a glowing object moving slowly across the sky from roughly s to n about 3540 i guess above the horizon
it appeared to move a bit faster than an airplane but very sluggish for any meteor
the color was reddishorange and brighter than the stars behind it but left no visible trail
the shape was diffuse and quite large like an actual ball of fire in the sky
the event lasted a very long time about 20 seconds as it travelled across the sky before the object shrunk into point and fizzled out
the whole time it emitted a constant glow no flickering or blinking
the only thing that makes sense to me here is a meteor or fireball but i cannot find anything quite matching this kind of description or behavior
anyone have an answer
while i realize the two have to work hand in hand to give the best results i am curious which piece of the optics puzzle is seen as being the most important if forced to choose between the two
from what i have read most of the pictures of a night sky filled with stars uses long exposure to capture the picture
this makes for stunning pictures of the milky way but shows us things our eyes cannot see
are there any pictures that show just what our eyes see in a low to no light pollution area
i have always lived near a city so i never really get to see many stars
just curious what it would look like being in an area with no light pollution
crazy amount of stars like the long exposure pictures or just slightly more stars than usual
so about a year ago i purchased my first telescope 8 manual dob my goal for this year is to observe as many objects in the messier catalogue as i can currently at 10110 i currently have an orion skyglow broadband filter which helps with the local light pollution but obviously this will not be the right filter for viewing nebulae and maybe galaxies
have not been able to find great info regarding galaxy filters for visual astronomy after doing some research i realized that the number of different types of narrowbanduhc filters is just overwhelming i am pretty sure i do not need to get an sii or nii filter and i probably do not need to get an hbeta filter since i am not going to be observing the horsehead but i have no idea if i should be looking to get an oiii ha or general uhc filter the different types of uhc are also a bit confusing if i am just starting out with viewing nebulae and galaxies looking to gain a better understanding of what type of filter i should be looking for so i can make a more informed purchase any help is greatly appreciated thank you
research for a fantasy book i am writing which includes the influence of the moon and planets into my world of magic but trying to get the real world facts right
i know the planets can never truely align but i am talking about the ad 949 event where all the other plants appeared in the same part of our sky
was this a recent calculation with modern algorithms
or pre 20th century
i am finding articles on the event just not when they came to that conclusion
hello all moments ago 114am eastern time new jersey area i was observing betelgeuse through my 8in dobsonian at around 100x magnification
all of a sudden around 56 objects of light in a small cluster all pass through the frame right infront of betelgeuse
the cluster width spread across the majority 7080 of my field of view through the eyepiece
the cluster was not a line or circle or any specific shape it was somewhat similar to the pleiades
they were in and out of my view in under a second and were a whiteishblue color each being similar to the size jupiter would have been under the same magnification and they all had a hazetrail around them
i immediately pulled back from the telescope and looked up with my bare eyes and could see nothing
i then pulled up stellarium to see if it could have been the iss or a satelite but stellarium showed nothing
i then pulled up flight tracker and ensured there were no planes in the area
any ideas on what this could have been
this was by far the most interestingcoolest thing i have observed to date
basic equipment for astrophotography
hi everyone i am posting here because text posts are not allowed on rastrophotography
i want to start out as an amateur astro photographer
the sheer amount of information on the net is so much yet it is so diverse that i cannot understand half the equipment they use
i have a basic 70mm refractor not so good which i used for casual viewing so i know the basics of telescopes
but going into astrophotography it gets so expensive
till now i have narrowed down what i have and can get for equipment
i have a nikon d3200 18270mm lens what i am planning on getting is a tracker and a good mounttripod 
will this be a good starting point 
please let me know your suggestions
what would you recommend to invest in if something else 
my budget is max 1000 thank you 
i am wanting to make a hobby project using motors to create two axis of rotation to track the sun
some questions i have however so as to not cheat and end up with a glorified clock is if the sun travels in a near circle around the observer
and can this circles inclinationdeclination be determined by simply accounting for the degrees of latitude the observer resides and of course accounting for the changing of seasons
bonus question assuming the above questions are true is the apparent motion of the sun relative to an observer on earth parallel to the motion of the earth relative to the sun
any help is appreciated
i am just a young engineer trying to use my background for something other than making money 
thank you kindly
hi this seems like the best community to ask this question but if not sorry for wasting your time
i am on a lookout for starmap projector for my young kids
i do not want to just create mood i want to show them actual stars and constellations
i set out with an expectation that i can find a projector that uses laser to display the actual starmap matched to timedate and with selected object brightness boy was i wrong
so this is kind of last resort i found that most projectors that use lasers actually use them to project some kind of kaleidoscopic stars that are not even randomized let alone accurate
others use a kind of slides they project onto a wall or ceiling problem is they are just photos so yeah
60s tech
i mean it sounds cheaper to buy pocket laser projector attach it to a raspberry pi and you can display whatever you want
is that an accurate assessment or have i missed some good product
as i was studying in my astronomy class today an image popped up of a quasar that was named after a high school science teacher who discovered it on galaxy zoo
since that is exactly what i am studying to be this peaked my interest
so after looking up galaxy zoo i then proceeded to spend two hours categorizing different galaxies from images of a telescope in hawaii
so if you ever want a slim chance of an astronomical object being named after you and not like buying a star online check out galaxyzooorg
and if categorizing images does not seem fun it is actually a pretty neat experience and the ui is smooth
worth a look
hey folks i am in maryland
i googled currently occurring meteor showers and saw that there are several sn taurids the leonids and the geminids
looks like the leonids are closest to peak so i am assuming that if i saw meteors tonight they are from that shower
saw a super bright very white light move across the sky for roughly a second twice
once around 830pm and again around 130am
definitely brighter than any meteor i have seen before like almost moonlevel brightness much smaller of course
i have seen a fair amount of meteors in my life it behaved similarly but it seemed to be much closer and covered a much smaller part of the sky
the internet tells me i might have seen fireballs if what i saw were indeed meteors
from what i understand seeing two fireballs in a day is quite rare
interestingly somebody told me they saw a shooting star behind me through the back glass of my car while we were on a zoom call recently
i dismissed it as some kind of glare because it seemed absurd to me that somebody would be able to see a meteor on a small screen through my back windshield in a brightly lit parking lot
makes me wonder whether they saw something similar
has anyone had a similar experience
or have any other ideas of what i may have seen
i saw a star on my way to work today and i used an app on my phone to identify it
the app called it p pup and said it was 67 ly away from us
the only star i was able to find using google is pi puppis but it is supposed to be 800 ly away
is there another star this could be or is the app just wrong about the distance
hello i made an opensource app that some might find interesting
it fetches nasa astronomy picture of the day and embeds the title and description
then puts it on display as wallpaper
main page source project made to try out c on macos
ended up pretty good i am going to

this is my 3rd post on this sub so i am sure some of you already know about this
i have posted this question in mathematics groups looking for an answer but so far i have not had anyone accept the challenge to help me
so if there is anyone in here who knows advanced math to calculate a new trajectory i would love to hear from you
the background first let me fill you in on what i am working on
i am currently developing a new pc strategy game in which you are an alien species from the sirius star system out there exploring the galaxy
i wanted to make it an alien species so you will eventually encounter humans on your journey
mostly the game will be about exploration and solving scenarios encountered along the way
the setup so to make everything even more accurate i pulled all the actual star chart data for our local stellar neighborhood
every star within 40 light years away will be a place you can visit in the game
the game will be designed to take into account distances for travel and communications
communications traveling at the speed of light and depending on your upgrades to the ship knowing the distance and your ships speed capability will allow the game to accurately present the ingame time it would take to do what you set out to do
so with that in mind i had to figure out not only the distance from our star to other stars but also the distance from star x to star y i was able to do this through some formulas set up in a spreadsheet
the spreadsheet takes the stars degreeshours minutes and seconds and converts it into the stars right ascension and declination and using that plus the distance the spreadsheet calculates the stars cartesian coordinates and then uses those to figure out the distance from one star to another
that part works very well and that math is already done
what is in a name while working on the storyline i realized that an alien species would not be using earth names for stars
if you were a highly organized spacetraveling alien species how would you name your stars
if it were me i would make them addresses instead
so what is known as alpha centauri here would be known as star 219902 60834 43441 the stars right ascension declination and distance from the home star would be a perfect addressing system for the stars
the problem some of you may have already noticed the problem with this
if i am an alien species with my home star being sirius then why are all my addresses calculated using sol as the home star
so what i need help with is i need to know the formula to enter into my spreadsheet to convert earth data into sirian data
it is a triangle right
a huge space triangle
i know the direction and the distance of two lines leaving our sun
those are two sides of a triangle
the math i already did gives me the length of that third line
now i need to know the angle at which that line exits sirius
i need a formula that will give me the right ascension and declination of any given star from the home star of sirius
attached you will find a sample of the spreadsheet showing the data for sirius sol and alpha centauri
obviously right now sol is all zeros because it is the home star
you can use this data to test the formula and make sirius all zeros instead
if it works for these 3 stars it should work for all 500 stars on my spreadsheet
 i looked at the map of the universe
it is explained there that the background radiation comes from the first flash of light emitted soon after the big bang
but a flash is essentially a shortlived event the microwave radiation goes on year after year
i understand the snow on our untuned tv screens half a century ago was caused by it
then what is an inhabitant of any other planet mercury through neptune
what about an inhabitant of our moon luna
disclaimer i am not suggesting anything such as alien existence but rather asking a purely hypothetical question for the sake of curiosity
wondering if anyone has any examples of well illustrated astronomical maps of the ptolemaic geocentric model of the solar system
i am looking to hang some large illustrations in my apartment but any original historic content is small and lacking detail
for the record i do not advocate geocentrism i just really enjoy the history of astronomy
for those that study or have studied asteroids or comets do you know does an asteroid or comet upon impact on earth deposit more of it is materials in the impact into the crater or does it spread out in arc x distance from the impact site
however on the moon when impacted how does an asteroid or comet deposit it is materials
does most of the debris just float back into space
there must be some exchange of materials for their to have been left a crater right
or can an impact actually compress the surface further
and leave most of the materials from the asteroid in the crater
curious if anyone has any insight
for context i am a photographer and keen to capture an interesting composition including the eclipse
this example by the incredible cody cobb is my favourite eclipse photo i have seen so far
looks like texas and mexico will be good for the sake of longest possible totality
i have made this map with a line following the middle of the totality with a fairly high degree of accuracy
i made it because i was finding all the maps i have found so far a bit annoying to use
scouring google maps is one of my favourite hobbies anyway so here are some locations i have found which look promising
 these arid valleys in mexico enchanted rock state natural area texas amistad reservoir texas this unnamed rock formation please share any suggestions you have for interesting looking locations which are unlikely to be swarming with people
hey everybody im looking for two comparable photographs of the earth at night from space
ideally the time span between the two of them is as big as possible
i want to illustrate the level of artificial light let us say between today and 1970 where can i find photographs like these
nasa did not reply neither the esa
thanks
i am quite new to astronomy and am currently making a motorized altazimuth mount
but i was wondering how many arc seconds per step are good for a motorized mount
i got together with some friends and their kids today to view planets and just after viewing jupiter i saw 3 objects that looked like stars forming a triangle
my first though was it looked like caph shedir and archid of cassiopeia but totally in a wrong part of the sky
when i went to reach our for stellarium to check it and looked back they were gone
time 1830 utc location alicante spain azalt 12649 22 08 i added a screenshot from stellarium for the reference
hello everyone
i have watched quite a lot of videos on black holes as well as read on them a sufficient amount
what do you think is the most likely fate of an astronaut who has just crossed the event horizon
i know we do not know what could possibly happen once the event horizon is crossed but i am wondering what is your most likely scenario
1 the astronaut is met with a blazing firewall of superheated particles which incinerates him in a microsecond
2 the astronaut sees the whole universe speed up and witnesses its end
3 the astronaut travels without sensing anything specialweird in particular to the ring singularity assuming the black hole spins which rips him to shreds
4 considering the black hole is enormously big it takes several hours for the astronaut to arrive at the ringularity
before even he reaches it he dies of asphyxiation due to lack of oxygen in his space suit
5 the astronaut reaches the ringularity and passes through it which leads him to another part in the universe
i am sure most of you have heard or read about these different scenarios
which one is the most likely and logical one
i am guessing it must be scenario number 3 but you never know what happens in there
or maybe you have another scenario in mind
 edit i think controls is a subfield but what is a certain questionproblem about controls
ldn 1630 barnard 33
this was my approximate location i was facing north west
it was around 330 am
it was pretty bright and broke off into two pieces
people say this picture is shaped like a heart
long story short i found many exoplanets that are in the habitable zone but none that are earth like going around a sunlike star
so i switched my search towards the stars that might have undiscovered planets
i am looking for not only habitable planets but planets that would be similar to earth
and for that i could not find any lists that would have the same requirements as i do
 requirements for the star distance up to 100ly age 2gyr or more binary no binary star within 1000 au planets no hot giants no strings of neptunes metallicity 50 or more spectral type f8 g8 explanation distance as close as possible obviously
considering that there are only about 1000 kgf type stars within 100ly that should give me a few habitable exoplanets somewhere there
so i am aiming for 20 70ly age i want intelligent life not just bacteria so i need to copy earth
i need billions of years for an oxygen atmosphere and for evolution
close binary stars make any planetary orbits unstable
that no bueno considering how delicate my system is
planets so this is the part that most people ignore
if i understand correctly most planets migrate toward their star
the reason why jupiter did not is because saturn and sequentially neptune stopped the movement due to their orbital resonance i assume this is only possible because two gas giants is a very rare phenomenon and it only happened because saturn is big enough to do that
most planets are like mini neptunes which happens when there is not enough material to create a jupiter size planet that would clear out the mini neptunes and leave behind an anulus of rocky material to form terrestrial planets
 metallicity following the planet forming logic i need more material in the disk and more metalrich material
so high metallicity indicates that there might be a more massive disk since it is a population i star more material in the star forming region and it will form more massive rocky cores that will attract more watermethane and more hhe afterwards creating a jupiter size giant
also that would leave behind more massive terrestrial planets after jupiters migration
spectral type again following the planet forming logic i need more mass to create a large disk that will not only create a two gas giants but also some leftover terrestrial planets
thus small k type stars are not good enough also larger stars are just to shortlived for life so f8 is max
not that k stars could not have theses kind of planets but i would think that would be less likely and i want the highest likelihood
let me start by saying i apologize if this is not the proper forum please point me to the proper one if this is not appropriate
i am using a telescope to track satellites and the output from our imaging camera is fits i have a few fits viewers but none do all the things i need i am looking for a fits image viewer that will take a large set of fits images and turn them into a video allow me to determine the centroid of a given object in the images will measure the fwhm of an object in the image to get an estimate of the seeing i am trying to analyze tracking performance of the telescope as it tracks satellites and the observing sessions can generate thousands of fits images ideally i would want a fits viewer that would allow me to quickly process these images to get the motion of the centroid of the satellite over the field of view during the observation
i do have matlab on my computer and experience using it for other applications so if there are matlab packages available that can do this i would be open to trying that i am ok if i have to write a little code but do not have the time available to build what i want from scratch
any guidance is greatly appreciated
does anyone have young children mine is 3 12 who are interested in space and have a starplanet projector in their room or playroom
my son has woken up several times early in the morning and will go open the blinds in his room to look at the sky
then he tells us all about what he saw when we get up
he frequently talks about the moon points out brighter objects in the sky etc
we started out wanting to get him a telescope for christmas but i am worried that if we get him a cheaper one he will lose interest if he cannot actually see something
on the flip side we do not want to buy our 3 12 year old a 500 telescope
additionally i would selfishly prefer to have a telescope that is somewhat automatic since i will be the one in cold chicago spending the time outside to get it all set up
so we are considering getting him something like this although this one might be a bit on the expensive side we would like it to actually show planets and stars and not just be a device that blasts dots all over the room
does anyone have any recommendations
thank you in advance
hey there i am trying to do some calculations to determine the apparent altitude of certain targets planetary and deep sky from a given position on earth similar to what you might see on telescopius but for a given date range
i am a professional developer so code is not a problem but i was wondering if there were any good resources apis packages for assisting with this kind of calculation
i have come across the python package skyfield which seems to be well puttogether but i am not sure if there is something better or which could be considered the standard
note that if the apparent altitude is off by a few fractions of a degree for a given target within a year or so from today it is not the end of the world for my purposes
thanks
i am currently in university doing a group project where we are woking with a nasaaffiliated organization to get feedback from 1330 year olds on how to improve one of their websites
the site is about eclipses so it should be interesting for members of this sub sorry if this goes against the rules
the website link is here it would be super helpful if you went through that page apprentice in the link and completed the short quizzes
then please fill out this google form with your feedback everything is anonymous and it would help us so much for our final project
if you have any questions you can pm or comment here amp i am happy to answer

hello
i am a self taught astronomy teacher at a high school
this means while some of my technical knowledge is really good i have a lot of holes in my knowledge especially with relativity
a student asked me this question when i was describing how the escape velocity of the event horizon of a black hole is higher than the speed of light
it stopped me dead in my tracks because i had the same question and i had no answer
if gravity acts on matter why is light energy trapped
i consulted a few websites and i think i understand but i am still not totally comfortable with the concept
here is an answer as i currently understand it because black holes are so massive they bend space time moreso than other celestial bodies
this warping of space time is what does not allow light to pass the event horizon
that is about the depth i can currently give
is this a sufficient answer
or am i totally missing something
arizona state university just advised me i have been accepted into their planetary and astronomical sciences online degree programbs

hello i have looked over the rules in helping to identify objects in the sky and this is neither a bird a plane nor a satellite
i had tried using an omni az 102 telescope with an attachment for a phone
i have observed this cloud multiple times over the course of 30 minutes and since it was changing in shape i wanted to check in with smarter people than myself
ampx200b i was initially trying to get a good picture of jupiter but did not quite line up the telescope all the way and saw the object right next to the planet
you can approximate the location based on jupiter and its satelites positions
taken from madison wi facing towards jupiter
object was observed multiple times and seems to have changed shapes between 718 and 755 cst 11302022

star projector that shows star trails or concentric circles in a hemisphere projection
is there such a thing
it does not need to be super detailed and accurate
really if it simply showed concentric circles as if it were a very long exposure photo of stars appearing to travel around polaris that was about as wide as a hemisphere that would be fantastic
anything past that would be gravy
i hope i am explaining this well
thanks for any suggestions you have
the purpose for this is simply to try and show people about star trails and how they look different depending on where you are facing and how the trails are longer the farther they are from polaris
also i understand that some of these or all of them take star disks of some sort
so failing that is it possible to put or somehow make a disk of concentric circles
as you can tell this does not necessarily need to be astronomically accurate
in the middle of this page is a very highpriced example in case it helps
thanks in advance

hello everyone hope it is okay to post here i am looking for some technical help
this is my 8 astronz dobsonian
as you can hear sorry about the breathing lol and see in the video my focuser has a repetitive rubbing sound when focusing in or out
and you can see it is created some lines along the tube from where the friction must be
this happens even when the knobs are loose so i am not sure what is causing it
and i do not know how it started but it happened after i think a family member fiddled with it while the focuser was locked with the lower knob being tightened
i got in contact with the man at astro nz and i believe he sent the video to the manufacturer but then i heard nothing back so i am hoping someone on here might have some insight to stop the friction
the telescope has continued to work as normal though i just would like to sort out this issue
also i am planning on selling the scope with a fair bit of accessories so message me an early inquiry if interested and close enough to auckland new zealand to pick up
hi a newagain astronomer here rediscovering the hobby after 20 years and with what i am sure is a newbie question what is the effective difference that field of view makes when considering two different eyepieces of the same type plossl etc and that have the same focal length
what difference does fov make ie
is a wider fov always better or under what circumstance would you want a narrower fov
for example i currently have a celestron powerseeker 60az with a focal length of 700mm am upgrading to a 90mm refractor soon and am considering purchasing a 6mm eyepiece in anticipation of this
these two seem very similar except one has a wider fov
how will this affect my viewing and recognizing that this eyepiece will likely be a little overpowered for my current telescope though technically just below the theoretical maximum of a 60mm700mm scope
goldline 6mm plossl nongoldline 6mm plossl what other differences are there to take note of when considering two otherwise similar eyepieces
one of these is cheaper but i am presuming that is for a good reason and recognizing these are both quite cheap anyway
thanks so much
we see the andromeda galaxy as it was 25 million years ago since earlier light has not had the time to reach us we also know it is moving towards us therefore it is safe to assume that currently andromeda is closer to us than it appears from the light emitted by it 25 million years ago
if we were to imagine a timelapse of andromeda from now to say 4 billion years in the future what would we actually see in this timelapse as andromeda approaches the milky way
will the discrepancy between andromedas apparent and real positions be gradually resolved until it is close enough that we can safely say that that is the real position of the galaxy relative to us
if yes when and how will this happen
does it also mean that the apparent size of the galaxy will have to increase abnormally fast to make up for this discrepancy until it is resolved
are there any running citizen science projects related to astronomy
i did some googling but the projects i found were either not operating or were not what i am looking for
i am particularly interested in projects that use your home telescope
i remember more than a decade ago there was a project that would point your telescope at a certain point in the sky
i am hoping there are more like this
zooniverse is complete
also are there any public databases of photos taken by the public
iirc there used to be a brand of telescopes that has come with software that allowed you to upload your photos for the public
thank you for your time
as the title suggests i am going to a dark sky site next weekend just right after the moon is done being full on the 127
i will be there 1281210
i have already looked at stellarium to see when we will possibly get some moonfree viewing but it does not look like much
i know that hazing in the atmosphere can play a big part in this as well
the place we are going to is a little on the drier side ie
desert
has anyone experienced being in such a dark sky with a pretty much full moon out
what was it like
i want to learn how to calculate where the sun will be in the sky relative to my position on earth on a specific date at a specific time
here is the catch i do not even know where to start
any tips or suggestions
here is what i have tried so far i asked the retired head of an academic planetarium
i have tried basic web research but again i simply do not know where to start
i appreciate understanding in the matter as i have not had need to think about this in a good while but imagining a system with 1 planet revolving 1 star would that planet have a shadow cast on anything
or could we consider it technically shadowless

yesterday my wife and i bought a meade star navigator 102mm from a guy who sells telescopes
he gave me 3 eyepieces 10mm 20mm amp a 2x barlow
last night it was cloudy but cleared up and we could see jupiter and it is planets but could not tell detail on jupiter at all
i am so new to all this and so confused with everything
is certain nights better than others 
i read something about how turbulent air can make planets blurry
also should i be able able to see cloud gases and nebulas with this telescope 
if i am right the telescopes max magnification is 202x i was at 168x with the barlow and 10mm yesterday
hello i am just recently getting interested in astrophotography after trying a few experiments photographing the orion constellation
i want to get a night sky application preferrably desktop so i can learn the positions of constellations and just generally explore the night sky when i am in the city and do not have a great view
i know i had a program like this at one point but i cannot remember what it was
i remembered a long time maybe 8 or 10 years ago i found a program that let you explore the universe and various astronomical objects
it was free and very high quality but i cannot remember the name of it at all
i have been searching one particular feature that i remember very well was the constellation highlighter
when you were near earth and turned it on most everything looked normal
but as you zoomed waaaay out the constellations would distort a ton because they look totally different from different angles
our constellations link stars together that are sometimes incredibly far apart and it gives this weird spiky appearance
the red dot in the center of my drawing is where our solar system would be
all of my searches so far just pull up iphone apps or celestrons starry night software
i was wondering if any of you all either knew what this program was or had a recommendation for a better one
also i have found the applications stellarium and also gaia sky
neither of them were the program i used to have
any help would be greatly appreciated
thanks

some sources wikipedia italy say that comets are mostly made of gas and ice
other sources inaf say that rosetta has shown evidence that ice is no more than 20 of the mass of a comet
so which one is true
my astronomy app says the planet is jupiter and if you watch it for a bit there is a red sparkle in the lower right of the planet goes off every 75 seconds or so
we have watched it for a few weeks and initially thought it was atmospheric disturbance but no matter the local weather we see that slight little sparkle keeping to an exact cadenceneptune is supposedly a few degrees away to the right in the skybut none of the other astronomy sky websites says they are that close to each other
this appears to be about 1100th of a degree away from jupiter

hi everyone crawford hill in holmdel nj is the site of the legendary holmdel horn antenna where bell labs researchers robert wilson and arno penzias discovered the existence of cosmic background radiation thereby proving the existence of the big bang

i am wanting to know what you get out of it
do you look at the same things all the time
do you try and see everything there is to see one at a time
i was thinking of buying a telescope and then thought if the majority of things you look at are going to appear as dots the same as with the naked eye why are you all doing it
i think i would enjoy the hobby but i am trying to figure out whether i would stick with it

tldr how do frequently travelling astronomers protect their telescopes in transit
longer tale possibly a strange note but i have been dragging a celestron 6e around se asia with me as i try to become a better astronomer and lay groundwork for a hopeful phd
my travel profile is i generally move a carryon backpack checkin duffel bag and the oversized telescope box to a place for 13 months
so was just in bali japan now in south of thailand
furure plans include s africa and south america and possibly japan again here is the issue i have been repacking the telescope and mount in the rather excellent box and padding it came in but on this most recent flight the box got left out in the rain and the cardboard got quite soggy as well as i am not sure anyone paid attention to the fragile and oversize nature
since i am thinking of spending the next year bopping around the globe i need a better solution for airline transportation to say nothing of the looks it gets when i am telling checkin its fragile whacking stickers and note son it in various languages as to it being fragile and then crossig my fingers for it at oversize dropoff
what has worked for more mobile astronomers
i have a nice padded tube bag for it i could use and maybe do carryon with it and the other bag and perhaps just put the mount and electronics in the duffel but quite curious if anyone has a good solution for frequent international travel with this telescope and something that is really worked for them i would love to hear it
thanks for any helpful replies in advance
quite curious what other people may have done or solutions that may exist that i have not seen
sure i cannot be the first person to try something so foolish 
phobos and deimos mars moon couple are 225km and 124km wide respectively
my friend argued that they are too small to qualify as moons of mars i know there are literally stars with diameters like that neutron stars but if there is not a size boundary for moons would not that make each individual rock in saturns ring one of its moons
on tuesday i was operating a flight from bucharest to badenbaden i am germany and about half way through the flight i noticed a light source which seemed to slowly increase in luminosity for about 34 seconds just to decrease again for the same amount of time
it did this about every 4 minutes or so
a good 20 minutes later my captain noticed there was another light source below the initial one which had the same increase and decrease in luminosity to it but at the same time also moved from left to right
another 10 minutes later it now looked like the two light sources were actually orbiting one another and were only visible while perpendicular to our flight path but not while parallel to it
we were both a bit flabbergasted and unable to articulate what we were looking at
does anyone here have an idea of what it might have been
i will attach two pictures to a comment showing a shot of the portion of the sky i saw the lights in roughly westnorthwesterly direction and a screenshot of our flight path and approximate position where i first saw them
my friend keeps texting me these trying to convince me that she got these photos of the occultation and says i am a fool when i tell her i think its just some kind of reflection
am i losing my mind

hello all so i am new to stargazing amp thought i would start with binoculars my first pair are a pair of pentax sp 20x60 wp observation binoculars these ones i am fully aware that they need to be mounted on a tripod or monopod in order to see stars without excessive shaking so i got an amazon basics monopod amp tripod on the monopod the shaking is still unbearable a little better than hand holding but not by much at all even on the tripod i cannot stop the shaking it is really excessive
it is not the bins moving its me i am standing trying to look through them awkwardly on a tripod trying to not touch them
what am i doing wrong here
i am determined to enjoy them amp get the most out of them
could it be the fact that the moon is almost full amp bright at the moment
could it be the fact that i am using budget tripod amp monopod amp a more expensive one would help
or could it be that i need to find a way to sit down amp use them
i would love to know perhaps my first set should not of been such high magnification at 20x or maybe i picked up the wrong pair
i done a fair bit of research prior to buying them from the review here they looked amazing for stargazing
but all i get is a tiny dot star wobbling around furiously amp can barely see anything 
cubesats are mostly placed in leo at am average distance of 2000 km from the earths surface
the free ions present in the upper layers of the earths atmosphere and the van allen belt can cause charge build up on the skin or components of the cubesat
this causes different areas of the cubesat have different potentials which can cause arcing leading to the destruction of the cubesat
does this problem statement make sense
i was thinking if someone we could extract this potential we can get a lot of electrical energy how relevant or possible do you guys think this idea is
i know it will happen after 4or 5 billion years and i will not be around but the thought that someday the earth will disappear gives me panic attacks 
someday everything will end if we go to mars even mars will end someday because nothing lasts forever and humans will cease to existi love stability planning everything in advance i always imagined that life was infinite like lazy eight i know i should focus on near future but i obsess about this topic and think what is point of developing human race and technology if we will cease to exist some day i have severe anxiety and ocd tendencies i am not believer i do not believe in afterlife which gives me even more depressing and nihilistic thoughts this is my recent phobia and i really hope i will grow out of this phase but right now i am really sad and depressed about it i would appreciate every positive outlook on the topic so much

gudday i am brand new to the hobby of amateur astronomy and recently got my first telescope a celestron 127eq powerseeker which came with what i believe to be a 5x24 finderscope
when i first got to setting up the finderscope i made sure to watch some youtube videos on the matter first and it seemed easy enough
but upon trying myself the whole thing went to ass almost immediately and i decided to fully unscrew the finderscope to try adjusting it dramatically which is when a little plastic slip thingy fell out and onto the ground
in a moment of complete and utter dumbassery i decided to just put it in my pocket and chuck it in the bin later and went back to adjusting my finderscope having no luck as before
was that plastic thing important
it seems like whenever i adjust the 3 screws to try centre my target it does nothing but draw the focus further away
is this a common struggle to have or am i just a complete dunce
any help or recommendations on what to do would be brilliant
finding the moon is not too much trouble but i would like to have the finderscope for assistance when i move on to searching for planets like saturn and mars and all that so i do not die of old age while fruitlessly looking for them
cheers
while the earth probably sops up most of what comes our way presumably the moon still gets hit by meteorites
in recorded human history have any large impacts been witnessed either directly or by the sudden appearance of a new crater
ampx200b small aside google has added a small but worth the visit treat to the search term meteorites
so laview is 117 and overall has good reviews sega flux homestar is more than double at 250 and seems also to have good reviews then dark skys chrome is again more than double at 600
has anyone here have experience with any of these or more than one
likely use in an average size master bedroom
i am not at all concerned with realistic placement or movement have celestron for that
primarily want it to look like real stars if you were out in the mountains then whatever the best looking galaxy discs would be
appreciate any insight
i am ok paying for the best one if it is worth the extra money relative to the others
thank you
hey just curious if anyone here knows anything about tates hell state forest on light pollution maps it says it is dark bortle 2 but i am just curious if anyone has a firsthand account
how can we see the structure of the arms from our position
how do we know that a star on the other side of the galactic centre is in one arm and not another
i am doing a project on stars and cannot find the age of this star anywhere
i was able to find it for the other stars i studied so i am assuming there has to be information somewhere
does anybody here know the age
hi want to ask if anyone knows where is the best place to catch the geminids meteor shower on 14 15 dec in singapore
i have a 76mm newtonian telescope
will be catching the showers with my daughters 7 11
hey folks i have a question about how the timing of the sunrise varies for high atmosphere low orbit objects
specifically i am working off this hypothetical a mirror array 50 km above the northern 45th parallel reflects sunlight directly onto the earths surface below assume the mirrors are articulate and always reflect light onto the same area on the surface
at equinox how long before a sea level sunrise will the mirrors be illuminated
how long after sunset
and how will these numbers vary at the summer and winter solstices
i hope i am not violating rule 4 here ive been reading through the wikipedia article on the sunrise equation and the mathbackground knowledge is above my level
the one line on correcting via elevation also seems to rely on atmospheric distortion which presumably varies at higher altitudes
thank you for your time
edit i managed some crude calculations and got a difference of 41 minutes at winter solstice and 68 at summer
still looking for feedback
should i get a new 5th edition or get a cheaper 3rd edition
i am unaware about the differences
i am a beginner so i do not have much clue about almost anything
thanks
hi guys i need to do a video about a sun anomaly that appeared on 2012 can someone point to me the best way to create videosobtain full res raw pictures of the sun
i need the highest resolution possible and the widest array of capturing sensors
thank you
i was trying with helioviewer but for some reason my computer does not like the website
heyho i have a worldbuilding related question
assuming i have a roughly terrestrial planet somewhere around earth or venus in size and mass what is the maximum number of moons i could make this planet have
moons here would not be the size of our own i am assuming but say they are meant to appear around half the size of ours in the night sky
what would that number kind of sort of look like
we have nothing planned for the first day so we thought we would just find somewhere to stop and stargaze
does anyone know where would be a good place to stop by and stargaze
i am finding it difficult to find good information despite my research
is it at the centre of a galaxy
if so which galaxy
thanks
kepler 186f is interesting
but everything is either from 2014 or a few new articles like this from this year
are there any resent studies or reports from more scientific sources
tried googling
got nothing
i am looking for a club in scotland i stay in the central belt i want one that meets up with telescopes and talks about it and not one that just sit in halls 
i am new to it i always wanted to get into it but waited till i could get a decent telescope i do know a bit about our solar system and galaxies as that is all i watch and read about
tonights my 1st night going out with it there is not a cloud in the sky
i cannot seem to find this information anywhere but could someone please tell me how old this asteroid is
i recently observed the geminids meteor shower and read that it is source is said to be 3200 phaethon but i cannot seem to discover the actual of age of this object the only thing i can find is when it was first observed
could someone please assist me
from this description of lymanbreak galaxies i do not understand how gtradiation at higher energies than the lyman limit at 912 is almost completely absorbed by neutral gas around starforming regions of galaxies
in the rest frame of the emitting galaxy the emitted spectrum is bright at wavelengths longer than 912 but very dim or imperceptible at shorter wavelengthsthis is known as a dropout or break
but the wikipedia page for the lyman series states that gtthe lyman series is a hydrogen spectral series of transitions and resulting ultraviolet emission lines of the hydrogen atom as an electron goes from n 2 to n 1 and gtthe greater the difference in the principal quantum numbers the higher the energy of the electromagnetic emission
it then states that gtthere are infinitely many spectral lines but they become very dense as they approach n the lyman limit 911753 nm i do not understand how neutral hydrogen can absorb light from a photon emitted with wavelength shorter than 912 angstroms if this wavelength is the highest energy photon hydrogen can absorb
so my question is how can there exist a wide dropout in the spectrum of galaxies at wavelengths shorter than about 912 nm if at n highestenergy electromagnetic radiation a hydrogen atom can emit or absorb is 911753 nm
how is the hydrogen interacting with photons of higherenergies than this
it must be a conceptual issue i am not understanding
hi
as a canadian acquiring an apertura ad8 is not possible orion sells and ships the skyline 8 to canada which is an equivalent but the shipping and brand cost makes it not really competitive
however i will be passing through the us in early january going from montreal to baltimore so through some newengland states
is there any place where it would be possible to buy the ad8 instore or at the very least ship it to a pickup location
i will be spending 2 days in baltimore from january 89 then going back home on the 10th
i just got my first decent starter telescope for my birthday
it is a celestron astromaster 102 refractor
got the finderscope aligned and tonight promptly saw jupiters major bands and all four of its moons
then mars then saturn and titan
excellent but my question is now where do i store my new telescope
it is maybe 28deg f outside and when i bring it in there is condensation starting
i assume it is not good to have the scope warmed and cooled a lot
is the garage an ok place to store it rather than in the house
thanks 
what are good alternatives to heavens above
i am currently using ha and sky view on android but am getting solid identification of what i am seeing only about 20 of the time and that is combined with the two apps
and these unknowns are not planesno flashing lights and no otherwise hits with flightradar 24 i find using the live sky chart on ha frustrating
i have read all their documentation and am instructed to use the overhead orientation so east and west and north and south are correctly indicated on the sky chart when the phone is held overhead but this only works if i am facing south
if i face north with overhead orientation as recommended not only are east and west wrong but north and south are also reversed
so if i see a satellite in the northern sky i have to do a back bend like some 13yr old gymnast to try to identify it with the sky chart orientation correct
sky views augmented reality viewing is sooo much easier to use and ensure that orientation is correct without risking a herniated disk but still only about 1 in 10 solid identifications here to
i get that there will be a delay between starlink launches and their final orbits to make themselves into the databases of these apps but it seems that 80 of the satellites i am seeing being attributed to such recent starlinks seems unlikely
hlo bros i am 15 yrs old high school student i want to know if during the first split second of big bang strong force bounded quarks into protons and neutrons or something like that how did those quarks came into being in that short period of time sorry if something i wrote was wrong
do they exist
if not would a theoretical one even be usable in learning where all the constellations are
and cross referencing with a sighted person for accuracy helpful in learning to locate starsconstellationsdeep space objects
would any other equipment be needed for this such as a compass
for context i am legally blind with no central vision thanks stargardts
if i were to use a telescope i could use my peripheral to actually see a few starshowever i want to become even if it stays a hobby for only a few years an astrophotographer
which means learning how to read a star chart
if it matters i am australian and therefore only really need the southern hemisphere part
technically for now i could find a larger print one and use a physical magnifier or an online star chart i can zoom in on
one day i may not be able to anymore
google has not been much help
i have found a few articles about making astronomy accessible however very little has focused on vision impairments
i know there is space sounds i am already looking ha into that
i know there is tactile galaxies and such
is there anything else out there
i just had the opportunity this weekend to watch this amazing documentary
it is a must
the music is great and i learn so much about spirit and opportunity missions on mars
in general you can reserve hotels 364 days in advance and buy air fares 330 days in advance
that is not too far off from now
for the 2017 eclipse hotels and campgrounds sold out months in advance
i do not have a good sense of the weather that day along the totality path
i see there is a sub on here but it appears to be dead
so thought i would ask here
i am interested in doing remote astrophotography with big telescopes and skies a lot better than my suburban light polluted junk
i like the idea of remote controlling telescopes a lot at least in theory but the few sites i discovered seem like they can get pretty pricey
slooh looks reasonable but i do not see a ton of options as far as imaging
i scheduled a mission but it seems they book them in short time slots like 5 to 10 mins so i will not be doing long exposures
not sure it is exactly what i am looking for but since there is a free trial figured why not
any other suggestions
personally i had never heard of dark photons before but the theory is kind of interesting
has anyone else heard of dark photon before
i got a tring adapter so i could connect a dslr to my newtonian telescope
it seems though that i have to use a 2x barlow otherwise it cannot focus on anything
this is fine for planets but does not seem to let in enough light for other objects like nebulas or even just stars
anyone know what is wrong
nasa says they have a plan to mitigate future micrometeoroid impacts like the 14 jwst has already endured 
ampx200b we brought together a group of stem students and educators and amateur and professional astronomers to propose names for exoplanets and their host stars to bring representationawareness to indigenouslanguages and their cultures
check out this video and more about our outreach project submission to the international astronomical union and the stories behind the cherokee and hiaced oodham names we proposed for these distant worlds at 
its nothing special probably crappy really cuz its made by national geographic and i do not know if they are good an nt114pm
well yeah
i kind of winged it cuz i could not find reviews online and i am worried cuz its from hobby lobby but i will get something better someday
so i just got a celestron starsense explorer dx 102az refractor telescope and i need some guidance
i was using a 10mm with 2x barlow this was the first time taking out the telescope and i aligned it and aimed it at jupiter since it was the brightest in the sky this is what i saw
my question is why does it look like that and am i need to do something also tried focusing but that just made it a tiny dot
jupiter i tried mars too and this is what it looked like
let us say i have an azimuth and altitude of a certain star how can i use it to find it and it is name
stellarium will not accept this format and i googled for hours with no luck
would appreciate some help
i live in rural northern colorado
i decided to be adventurous on this onceinalifetime cold spell and do some night scape photography
i walked about 13 a mile to get these shots and my thermometer said it was 20f without windchill
 if you are out in this cold spell i know it is much worse in other places stay warm
be safe have a merry christmas and a blessed new year
clear skies
in science communication when mentioning an astronomical distance it is very common to put a distance in light years into the time when the light was emitted for this object which is 70 million light years away the light was emitted when the dinosaurs still roamed the earth or something similar
i think that this makes very little sense and is at best irrelevant
there are four reasons for this
1 the average person has about as much idea about how long ago things are compared with how far things are
people know dinosaurs existed very long ago but exactly how long
the average joe on the street does not have a concrete idea
so linking distances to times does not make too much sense
2 it encourages confusion
there are countless times i had to explain that even though the light was emitted 70 million years ago the dinosaurs would not have seen what we are seeing because of causality
3 the light travel times of local universe objects i am calling local universe anything below z01 is quite irrelevant because the universe did not change that much in the meantime
the universe we are detecting might as well be now
it is more meaningful to describe sn1987a as happening 35 years ago rather than thousands of years ago
for high redshift objects surethe properties of these objects are different that the look back time is relevant but not local galaxies
4 it does not actually explain anything usually
since distance units in science communication is usually light years you are essentially replacing the unit in distance with the unit in time with the same value
this does not actually reduce the issue of big numbers to the layman but actually just kicks the can down the road
if people know what lightyear means then adding the sentence about the light travel time does not add anything to the discussion
i look forward to hearing your opinions on this
would it just be an exo moon 
or would it become an asteroid 
sorry
so i just received my first orion 80mm st i pointed it at jupiteri believe yet i only saw basically a glowing dot
i was using my 25mm eye piece
i do have a 2x barlow and a 10mm aswell
is it something that i am doing the power of the telescope or a combo
i was under the assumption from what i saw that jupiter would at least be somewhat visible at the least maybe unable to tell color bands but at least you could tell
any thoughts
i bought the celestron skymaster 25x100s as a gift for someone and yes they are very heavy
i underestimated just how much they cannot be handheld so i tried them with a walmart tripod i had bought lol and the tripod definitely was not it
so i went out and bought the celestron heavy duty altazimuth tripod hoping it would resolve my tripod needs especially after reading some reviews on amazon and here on reddit saying that they paired their 25x100s with it
unfortunately i am a clueless amateur beginner because i cannot figure out how to mount these magnificent monsters to the 14 inch screw mount
in fact i cannot figure out too much with this tripod because it came with no manual and the reviews and suggestions from people online vary greatly in time and method
i trust the reviews i trust it is possible to pair the 25x100s with the altazimuth but i do not know if i am missing something here or need to go allin on a parallelogram mount like the orion 5376 paragonplus binocular mount
i was hoping to not keep on throwing money into a pit here but at this point i think i will have to
any insights greatly appreciated thank you all
what would the mass be of saturns rings if you excluded moons and moonlets anything spherical due to its own gravity
i love this community soo much the response i get back is soo quick thanks everyone for helping everyone and everybody
i live in a pretty bright city
when i ventured deep into the desert at night i barely saw the milky way properly only very very faintly
it is hard to tell what you can see because most pictures are highly processed
i understand the moon is bright because it reflects sunlight like how a flashlight would illuminate a rock behind a tree
however that rock would only appear bright not have a glowing ring around it
so why does the moon appear this way
hello folks here is a question that could be easily solved if i pulled some pen and paper and did some basic geometry calculators
but i have none at the moment so
also it is surprisingly hard to find info on tropical location astronomy or maybe i am just not searching it right but i have always been curious
i live in the southern hemisphere so the moon looks a particular way to me you can see the maria swirling anticlockwise leaving a tail and tycho the crater looks like the moons mouth like a bottle
also the moon fills up left to right like how we write ignore upside northernercreated down emoji 
moon occasional tilt not included of course
in the northern hemisphere it is of course upside down
the maria look like it is swirling clockwise tycho looks like the moons butthole explains the term mooning i guess and the moon fills from right to left like many semitic alphabets 
it all makes sense of course you are seeing a ball from the different hemispheres of a sphere
however things get whacky when you see it from the equator
i have been to more equatorial latitudes a few times but never by long enough to see the full moon cycle like i have from higher latitudes in the northern and southern hemispheres and i have never seen a full moon there
the times i have seen the moon they were either waxing or crescent cannot remember exactly which but i distinctly remember them looking very prominently tilted and very strong horns both pointing upwards and pointing downwards and maybe the moon was sideways
as in tycho was the moons navel
hard to tell from so little being illuminated
when i google tropical latitude moons i get all sorts of moons you would think the tropical moon is random
does it fill from bottom up then just rotates 45 and does a pirouette
i do not know the internet does not seem to be eager to answer that either
was just thinking about this
so jupiter for example spins on its axis
this spin contributes to storms like the big red eye of sauron
a black hole will have a accretion disk
will there be storms in that disk
hurricane likes storms that are rotating
i am imagining the answer is either yes they do haves storms or that the gas is orbiting so fast that maybe it cannot form storms or maybe the disk is too compressed or something
total amateur here so i have no idea
hi anyone know the specifications of the televue barlow thread
thanks
i am trying to learn ptolemys almagest but it is hard to visualize certain things
for example how the sun travels around the ecliptic in its diurnal motion while remaining within the zodiac
i live in a big city so i cannot track celestial bodies myself
i was wondering if there is an app that projects various locationspaths like the ecliptic the tropics the meridian the zodiac etc onto the sky to help me visualize what is going on
thanks in advance
