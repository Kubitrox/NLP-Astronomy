Basically looking for an answer a little more in depth than \u201cexplain like I am 5\u201d. \n\nI know that light continues to be visible long after the source has gone out and is constantly moving outward from its origin point at the speed of light. Since it doesn\u2019t interact with anything in the vast majority of space it does not change velocity and continues to infinity.\n\nThe part I am confused about is how interaction with an object then affects that light. We can see things like Mars and Venus (even by the naked eye) due to the light reflecting off of the planet. So obviously even with the change of velocity it is possible for the light reach some other objects. Is that light still moving at the speed of light? If so why are objects further away dimmer? Is it due to light scatter? If the sun were suddenly gone would we continue to see the other planets longer than we would see the light from the sun?",

Perhaps this is against the rules of this subreddit, as it is a too simple question, but I couldn't find anything that really answers this question...\n\nSo, you probably know how Neutron Stars are often depicted as these very bright, light blue spheres. I had this image, and still have it in my head, but one time, about one and a half years ago, my physics teacher told me, that Neutron Stars don't actually emit visible light. If I remember right, he told me that it's because of that Neutron Stars don't do fusion energy anymore. However, on another evening he told me that white dwarves don't do either, but they glow because of all the heat that's left. But Neutron Stars are very very hot too, even hotter than white dwarves as far as I know. I asked him as well if it could just be because our tools aren't good enough to actually take a picture, or something alike, because they're only 12 or so km in size, which is really nothing compared to the they have to Earth. Unfortunately I don't remember his answer. Is he just... not informed well enough? I highly doubt it, I mean, a physics should know what he's talking about?\n\nAnyways, I know that Neutron Stars emit different frequencies of light, but the question is just, do they also emit visible light? I need to know, if this picture of Neutron Stars that I, and I suppose so many other people have, is just a lie.\n\nThank you for answers, and have a bit of patience with me if I don't understand them right ahead.",

How can one tell whether or not an object can be seen through a telescope using celestial coordinates (i.e. right ascension and declination)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best thing I've found is [something](http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/PMU199L0111/index.php/How_to_Figure_Out_Which_Objects_are_Visible_to_Which_Telescopes) written by The University of Toronto. It does tell that when the declination of an object is within a certain range, then the object can be seen. However if an object isn't within this range it just skips over how to use the right ascension and tell us to rather use a website because it involves complex math. But that's exactly what I need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn't find anything else online to solve my problem. So if anyone could answer my question or tell me where to find the appropriate ressources I'd greatly appreciate it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For those who may want the answer, I converted the right ascension and the declination in [Az/Alt coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system) and then you just have to check whether the Altitude is between 0 and 90 degrees",

        "selftext": "Good day fellow enthusiasts,\n\nI've just recently been thrust into the magnificent world of amateur astronomy and I am very anxious about making everything as perfect as possible. It's not that I don't have any know-how, I do, theoretically, since I've been interested in this from my early childhood and I am also now a physics major at an undergrad level who takes additional courses in astronomy, but am overwhelmed with the practical aspect of observation. My first and only telescope is a Celestron Power Seeker 127EQ ([https://www.celestron.com/products/powerseeker-127eq-telescope](https://www.celestron.com/products/powerseeker-127eq-telescope)). I'm having it shipped over via Amazon and I now fear in which condition it's going to arrive in. I'm thinking that it must be misaligned and am thus wondering whether or not I need to buy a collimator alongside it.\n\nI looked into multiple collimating options, be it with a laser one, Cheshire or with homemade caps with small hole in the center. I now wonder what the best option for me is - should I buy one of those collimators? Would it be sufficient for me just to eyeball it with the homemade abomination of a collimating eyepiece and/or do a \"star-test\", i.e. defocusing a bright star and trying to make all the emergent circles concentric? I've invested a pretty penny into this telescope and thus I'm hesitant of any other further expenses. Also, the telescope is coming any day now, so, even if I order a collimator now, it would take some time to get here, so I'd have to wait which would just prolong my overthinking-induced problems.\n\nAnyways, thank you all for reading all the way through, and, if you have any, and I mean any suggestions or opinions, please write them right here.",

It sounded really cool and strange due to there being a lot of raw bitmap icon data stored in the executable file's resources. Here it is: https://youtu.be/2xZgCVG_Bzk\n\nBut, people started commenting on my video claiming they've heard this as \"Nereid's Sound\". Apparently someone stole my exact audio from my video (it has all my specific edits intact), mixed in some ethereal sounds, and uploaded it, pretending it was the sound of Neptune's moon Nereid.\n\nNow I know, there are legitimate sounds recorded from planets' electromagnetic emissions. But there is zero doubt that people have stolen my audio to make a fake \"Nereid's Sound\". I found a few examples on YouTube but by now it's apparently somewhat in the internet collective consciousness, which is scary, because it's an example of how fast misinformation propagates.\n\nExample 1: https://youtu.be/fakankfe8co\n\nExample 2: https://youtu.be/WCrhKKSYDUo\n\nExample 3: https://youtu.be/o2TKskFlBbo\n\nAnd that's just 3, there's a lot more I think.\n\nI've heard other supposed \"sounds from moons\" that have very similar sounding audio; those could easily be fake as well, but I can't be 100% sure with those like I am with this one.\n\nI'm making this post because I wanted to reach as many people as possible to dispel this misinformation. Thank you for taking a look at this.\n\nEdit: The person who originally stole the sound was just like 11 or 12 when they did it, and they've apologized and given me credit: https://www.reddit.com/user/r2bl3nd/comments/v706tf/the_person_who_stole_my_sound_actually_apologized/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nHowever that doesn't mean this misinformation will immediately completely disappear, so I'm keeping this post up.

        "selftext": "Greetings everyone.\nI have been wondering about this for some time, but I cannot manage to get a straight answer from the Internet. Searching \"astronomic calendar\" only shows me a calendar of astronomical events such as visible planets and other objects at a certain moment of the year. And elaborating more the question to the search engine only gives me more trending topics without a trace of an answer.\n\nSo here's my reflection. Excuse me beforehand if I fall into \"noobish\" presumptions about the topic, this not my field of expertise nor my main hobby. Also sorry if I lack the technical English vocabulary to express myself with accuracy.\n\nSoooo, the premises: \n1. Earth orbits the sun. Okay? Okay. This orbit is the yearly cycle. \n2. The firmament is \"static\" around the solar system. Well, the system orbits the center of the galaxy, but I understand that the scale of this orbit is so big space-time wise, that we can consider our system static during our lifespan. Correct me here if I'm wrong.\n3. While orbiting the sun, the Earth also rotates on its polar axis. The dayly cycle.\n\n\nPremises over the table, time for the thought:\nSo at a certain time of the year, the day sky and night sky will be the same regardless of the observer's longitude. Only latitude will make you see a different sun course during the day and the same for stars visibility in the night. So far this makes sense to me, knowing the longer day/night cycles are the closer you go to the Earth's poles, and the existence of the Polar Star which was used in the past to locate the north, because it is always above the north pole.\n\nConclussion!\n\n- Romans defined their zodiac constelations belt from Rome, and as long as you live at a close altitude of that of Rome, you will be able to see all of the constelations consistently over the year.\n\n- And if the firmament is \"fixed\" around the solar system, then the same constelations will be visible always at the same seasons, maybe with slight differences over the course of the years.\n\n- So from my country (Spain) the most visible constellations I can see these days are Scorpio and Aries, and some more should be visible in a clear night with no building around. Next year around these same dates, I should be able to see these guys aproximately in the same manner. And if I observe week after week, month after month, the evolution of the zodiac belt and get used to it over time, in a future I should be able to tell if summer is coming or if we are still mid-winter just by looking the constellations, without having a proper calendar at hand. \n\nI mean, it sounds obvious to me that if a culture defined a set of constelations, was mainly in order to guide themselves over the seasons. Greeks did it before Romans, and Chinese did it too, and for sure many more.\n\nIt's just, the fact that I'm unable to see any reference to this on the Internet makes me wonder if am I inventing pure nonsense or is the world around me losing the roots of awesome metodology and knowledge?!\n\n\nI hope this reflection entertained you, and a response will be helpful!\n\nEdit: Correction for correct use of longitude and latitude terms.",

I live near Milwaukee Wisconsin, so to avoid city lights I watch from the lakeshore beach where bluffs block out the western third of the sky and the city lights.\n\nFrom what I've read, the showers will peak on August 11-13 this year.  However there will also be a bright moon.  Between my limited sky view and the moon, I'm trying to determine if any of those days is better than the others, and if my usual 3-5 AM watch period is good.\n\nBased on this moonrise/moonset calculator, the moon will be going down in the south/southwest shortly before sunrise.  If I watch a couple days earlier, I'll get less moon but also miss the peak days for the showers.\n\n[https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/usa/milwaukee?month=8](https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/usa/milwaukee?month=8)\n\nAny recommendations on optimizing the experience would be appreciated.

And I\u2019ve been trying to take photographs with my SONY a7c DSLR camera, but I can\u2019t get perfect focus. Now here comes more problems, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a camera/back focus OR a calibration problem. [This is the photo](https://imgur.com/a/sldzZh3) I get when I take a photo of the moon (+ photo of leaves) with my DSLR camera, a t-ring and a t-adapter. This is the most focused I can get it to be, yet with an eyepiece the moon is clear and in perfect focus. (Then it couldn\u2019t be a calibration problem right?)\n\nNow that night, since it was perfectly focused (w/ eyepiece) on the moon I tried to focus this telescope on a bright star, and came to a bigger problem, can\u2019t get it to be focused on the star in general. The star can\u2019t reach a focus where it\u2019s a small dot, the closest I could get the star to focus [was this](https://imgur.com/a/xVnRVTz)(and it\u2019s similar with dslr photo as looking through the eyepiece, give or take). This is where I might think it\u2019s a calibration problem.\n\nToday I tried to get the camera focused with a 2x Barlow lens, [this is the photo](https://imgur.com/a/haTVgXm)of the focus I got and the setup. And I tried to insert the Barlow halfway, only the tip, every length I got it into the telescope it would still reach that same BAD focus. So basically this Barlow only increased the focus problem rather than help. Unless I did something wrong.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do and how to get my camera to focus on objects from the telescope. What could be the problem? Anyone have any suggestions what I should do and look into?",

If a moon of a gas giant is in a calmer area of the planet's magnetic field - not inside a radiation belt - would the planet's magnetosphere protect it from the star's radiation?

The best one I could find is [this edited crummy image from Voyager 1](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA01970.jpg) or maps wrapped around digital spheres.

Europa has no red stripes. No orange stripes. No blue or lemon yellow patches. No strong colors and no strong contrasts. It's icy regolith with cracks and traces of tholins.\n\nWhen you search for \"Europa in true color\" (and variations of the phrase), you even get totally misleading articles where one less crazy color image is deemed as true because it's set against one with very crazy colors.\n\nIt shouldn't be so hard. Cassini had a rich filter wheel on its powerful telescope and I'm sure it delivered red, blue and green data. It just needs to be properly assembled, yet nobody bothered to do so.\n\nLet's try to find it and change the misinformation on Wikipedia.",

I am using a telescope network called skynet to do these observations.\n\nMy question is: if I added 45 mins (90 arc min radius divided by 2 to give me halfway out from the center) to the declination that is given for Andromeda, would that give me the coordinates for halfway out from the center of the galaxy, or some random patch of sky that I don't care about?\n\nI have two images linked here, one is the pre-given coordinates given to me by skynet, and the other is the declination after I added about 45 minutes to it.

I have researched on what wavelengths I should be on in my jobs doing at-home cable jobs, but that is not comparable to a signal like what I\u2019m looking for. I know I can upgrade to a more sensitive receiver, but will it matter? Should I switch to a different antenna? Am I just wasting my time with something that should be left to the ones that can afford huge multi-million dollar/multi-stage equipment to feed me the answers I want?\n\nEdit: receiver meaning low noise amplifier.

I looked out through the window and it was a clear sky. So I decided to go out and do some lunar + planetary observation and imaging. Yep, I'm a Recreational Astronomer who does stuff like this for fun and to contemplate on my own life. I parked my car in a random spot and did my thing for about an hour.\n  \nJust when I was about to pack my stuff and leave, three homeless people approached me. They weren't drunk or high so I wasn't worried. They asked if they can look through my Telescope and I pointed my scope towards the moon \ud83c\udf19 It was a beautiful crescent and my scope (dobs 8\") is powerful enough to reveal craters and much more specific details. So they were surprised to look at the moon that close and started discussing with me about Astronomy. One of them even knew about the James Webb Space Telescope.!! After about 5 mins, they asked me my name (Mohammed), thanked me immensely and left me after sharing their view that a lot of people don't even talk to folks like them and I was kind enough to show them the Moon. My mentor the previous day told us that old people just feel lonely sometimes and spending some quality time with them would be the best thing to do at times. He was talking about senior housing crisis but these people are no different than that too. I was glad that I could do the best I can by putting some smile in their faces that morning. I'll always continue to include everyone in my journey of sharing my passion and I was lucky I had 3 guests that day.\n  \nThanks for reading, have a nice and cozy Sunday \ud83c\udf25\ufe0f\n\nIf you'd like to support and follow me in my journey, here's my [Instagram ](https://instagram.com/mohammed_astrophotography?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)",

It\u2019s about 3.5 hours away from me, so I want to make sure that I plan accordingly. The best weekend for me to go (schedule-wise) is August 6-7. \n\nOn August 6, the moon is going to be in its waxing gibbous phase, which I know is not great for viewing the night sky. I  checked moonrise and moon set times, and it says that the moon is going to set at 1:05 a.m. on August 6, which is the night I would be viewing the stars. Does this mean that the moon will be out of view in the sky, meaning that it won\u2019t hurt the visibility of the stars? I really want to make my trip worth it and would rather not travel such a distance to barely see much so I\u2019d love some advice!",

        "title": "A heads up, primarily for southern hemisphere observers - three meteor showers to peak this weekend and put on a decent (but not spectacular) show",
        "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nJust wanted to bring to everyone's attention the fact that it's a reasonably good time to do some meteor observing at the moment :)  It's pretty much new Moon (yay! Dark skies!), and,  being the southern hemisphere winter, we get some long dark nights :) So that's all cool anyway.\n\nAt the moment, we've got three half-decent meteor showers active. One, the Delta Aquariids, is one of the better showers of the year for southern hemisphere observers (though not a match for May's Eta Aquariids or December's Geminids). At its peak, this coming weekend, it has a forecast ZHR of 25.\n\nFor those who aren't familiar with it, the ZHR of a meteor shower is the 'Zenithal Hourly Rate' - it's an estimate of the number of meteors you would see in an hour under absolutely perfect conditions. So, in reality, you'll see fewer meteors than the ZHR. Meteors in a given meteor shower appear to radiate from a certain point in the night sky - the radiant of the shower. The higher the radiant is in the sky, the more meteors you'll see from that shower. If the radiant is below the horizon, you won't see anything from the shower, as the meteors will all be hitting the far side of the Earth.\n\nSo, for the Delta Aquariids, the radiant is near the star Delta Aquarii. When that star is low in the sky, the rates you see from the shower will be lower - and the higher the star gets, the better the rates you see will be. On Saturday night, Skat (Delta Aquarii) will culminate (be at its highest) at around 2:15am - which means that's when you can expect to see peak rates from the meteor shower. Make sense?\n\nThe Delta Aquariids are the main event. Skat rises in the relatively early evening at the moment, meaning that shower meteors are visible all night - but decent rates will only be seen once it has climbed a bit in the sky. If you want to check when it rises where you are, go to Stellarium (the web version is great - but I dunno if I can link it here!), search for 'Skat', and then lock it in and move time forwards and backwards!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of the Delta Aquariids, there are two other more minor showers that peak around the same time. The Alpha Capricornids are great - although they're a weak shower (ZHR around 5 at peak), they have a reputation for producing lots of bright meteors and even fireballs. Where Delta Aquariid meteors are medium-fast, the Alpha Capricornids are markedly slower, which makes them a good target for astrophotographers (though the low rates can be frustrating!). Then we have the Piscis Austrinids - another minor shower with peak ZHRs of around 5. Meteors from this shower are faster than Alpha Capricornids, but slower than Delta Aquariids...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe radiants of the three showers are relatively close to each other in the sky - meaning that all are high in the sky for those of us in the southern hemisphere for the hours around midnight and into the early morning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat does all this mean? Well, this weekend is a good time to get out somewhere dark, rug up nice and warm, and lay out under the stars for a few hours - take a friend, and a warm drink, and lie back and relax :) I'm not promising a meteor storm or anything like that - but the rates can be quite impressive when added together. A couple of years back, at an astro meet up here in Queensland, I counted 50 meteors in three hours from the three showers combined - so a pretty nice treat in the middle of winter :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for where to look - a good tip to maximise the number of meteors you see is to work out where the radiants of the showers are, and to look about 45 degrees above the horizon, about thirty to 45 degrees left or right of that point (wherever the sky is darkest). That's a good way of maximising the number of meteors you'll see by maximising the amount of the Earth's atmosphere you're looking for without looking so low in the sky that you're looking through loads of gunk and grot in the sky!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis meteor shower calendar on SpaceAustralia's website has some good finder chats, if you're interested in going out looking :) It's obviously got an Australia-centric theme - but the charts should help wherever you are :) [https://spaceaustralia.com/news/ultimate-sky-guide-catching-meteors-your-backyard-2022](https://spaceaustralia.com/news/ultimate-sky-guide-catching-meteors-your-backyard-2022)\n\nEnjoy!",

I am not an expert on astronomy, so it's not something I just know or can figure out, and I'm to curious to give up on getting an answer. Context first, I was just sitting around as you do and the thought of looking \"down\" upon the Milky Way as an outside observer from maybe, I don't know, let's assume 500,000 light years or so, came into mind. I began wondering what it would look like to a human eye. The first thought was of course of a beautiful combination of colors and stars that are very visible, like the exposure images we commonly see of other galaxies. However, I eventually thought that maybe, thats not how it would look to us at all. I mean, we from Earth with the naked eye can only see individual stars systems that are \\~17000 light years away without any equipment, right? So would that be the same from intergalactic space from a distance significantly larger than 17000 light years, or would the accumulated brightness of all 200 billion or so stars be enough to create the visual we imagine when we think \"galaxy\". I mean, the Andromeda galaxy is just a dim smudge in the night sky, but it's also 1.5x farther away that the distance we are using in our \"outside observer\" example. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my question to the astronomers or reddit is : From the outside, would the Milky Way be bright enough to be viewed in a way similar to that of the artist renditions and the other galaxies in images, or would to appear like the Andromeda galaxy does to us from Earth?

If that\u2019s the case, what are some typical speeds for the propagation?

Well, I did for sure. Like most of us, space has always been a central theme on my life; from games, toys, t-shirts, star-projectors and who can forget those little glow-in-the-dark stars you glued to your ceiling.\n\nBecause of the world we live in we probably were discouraged on our profession and chose something more down to earth, since we felt astronomy may not be the way to go carreer/money-wise. I chose engineering.\n\nI'm 27, about to turn 28 and I've been feeling this void inside for a while, telling me that what I'm doing is not what I should be doing or that I could have more joy in my life. This feeling grew even more when the first pictures from JWST got released and I couldn't help but cry when I saw them. Seeing the beauty of the vastness of space lit up that spark inside of me once again.\n\nI want to get back on track. We're about 2.5M people in this community and some of the people here luckily got the chance to make a living out of this passion. I want that.\n\nIf any of you, reading this, are, I'd like to be involved in any way possible just to have this sense of purpose back in my life. Be it that you need some kind of assistant to crunch numbers, or another pair of eyes and ears to have input on an idea or discovery. Not looking for a job per se, but just by being part of the field or being surrounded by people that enjoy this the same as I do, at least gives me a chance to some day work doing what I love, looking at space.",

I can easily find my 'anchor' stars with the naked eye. But when looking through the finderscope (a right-angle scope with an erect image), there are so many more stars visible that it's very difficult for me to figure out if I'm looking at the same area I spotted visually. If my 'anchor' star is extremely bright, sometimes I'll be able to spot it in the scope, but otherwise it feels like a crapshoot. Consequently, there are many objects whose locations I could point to visually but just struggle to aim the telescope at.\n\n\n\nIs this a common problem? I could imagine attaching a green laser to the scope to make this easy but there's got to be another way, right?\n\n\nThanks...",

I've referred to the chart from rule #3 and it is not a Chinese lantern. It is very far away. Its as tiny and bright as any other star on the sky. It will stay completely stationary, then move very fast in either direction, then go on to be completely stationary again. This does not happen in any regular intervals, just every now and then. I'm assuming it is very far away and therefore really fast. Any idea what that could be? I've been just looking at it in awe for a couple of minutes. If its a manmade satellite, how much fuel does it have? I don't doubt we have the technology but it is very fast and precise.",

Consider a horizontal line being my balcony and if we form a vertical line at 90% angle in exact between and that is where sun always has been. ( I am myself laughing writing this :D )\n\nRecently, since last few months/week I have noticed the sun axis or it's rising almost 120% or more angle towards left, meaning over recent months/ possible year, Sunrise is happening or more visible towards the left side of my balcony.\n\nI seriously hope this is making sense because frankly even am laughing but I am intrigued. Not a scientist etc. but am sure daily things too make us wonder what's happening and this question has been with me since months now, hence thought of reaching out ..\n\nI hope someone has explanation to this or any thoughts .. if not, at least I hope you too laughed on my curious funny mind :D\n\nAttached is old pic - 2020 I think and you can see sunrise here ..

Whatever that was, was at about 21h55m +47\u00b020'.\n\nIt was about as bright as a plane at cruising altitude. I was lying there hunting for meteors for an hour so. It blinked two or three times, with maybe half a second between the pulsee. Then it was dark for one or two seconds and then had a last blink. And then it was gone. It all lasted for about 5 secods and didn't seem to move during that time.\nSo I can exclude a star, planet, ISS, plane (1), meteor, satellite (2). I also don't think it was an iridium flare, they tend to move fast enough to perceive their change in location.\n\n(1) except for maybe very high altitude military drones? But then why would they blink four times and then go dark again...\n\n(2) Geostationary satellite that sometimes happen to reflect a lot of light? But I can't imagine that a satellite at 35.000 km can be seen with a naked eye.\n\nAnd no, I was not sleeping and I am not drunk or high  :)\n\nSo, yeah.

It had an overall black background with blue and white text, and the vast majority of the stars were labeled and *the dots were scaled to represent magnitude*. Several other celestial objects like the Magellanic Clouds and  a few galaxies were also included. \n\nThe shape of the map within the rectangular poster was of the night sky, in one giant ellipse, with the galactic center at the center of the map, galactic north was up, etc.  It looked a bit like [this](https://www.go-astronomy.com/images/constellations.jpg) but with a ton of labels, possible only because of the map's large size. It also didn't really need highlighting of the central plane, since there were enough dots to show it naturally. What I liked about it was the edge-on/cross-section look, instead of the artificial perspective of viewing the galaxy from a point far above the galactic plane. \n\nI've searched and searched and can't find it, and don't know that I could print something so big on my own. Maybe there are specialty map publishers that could re-create it, or maybe someone else had a copy of the map and remembers the publisher.

I am very much an amateur on this subject matter, so I thought I would post it here, and I am by no means attempting to start a heated debate or argument. I'm simply wondering if someone with a far greater understanding of the physics of space can say whether or not this hypothesis holds any water. To me, Lerner's arguments seem vague at best, but I could very much be wrong. I know he wrote a book on the issue back in 1991, so it seems like he would be biased. But I'm just curious: Are we in the middle of a paradigm shift because of the JWT images, as far as the Big Bang is concerned? Or is Lerner more of an outsider just trying to promote his own work?

To this day in 15-20 attempts between both scopes I've gotten Sky Align to work once. I thought with the GPS on the new it would really make things easier, but tonight trying it for the first time it outright failed on 3 attempts, and the one that \"worked\" immediately slewed to the wrong side of the sky for Saturn. The problem is clearly with me, but I'm at a loss as to what I'm doing wrong. I've watched the youtube videos etc. I try to pick lower horizon targets across a wide area of sky when visibility permits. Trying to manually track with the hand controller at these focal lengths is sucking the joy out of it, much less trying to change out an eye piece or really experiment with different barlow/eyepiece/filter combos.",

The question is the following: What is the origin of the solar nebula? \n\nSo far I understand this:\n\n* The solar nebula was a large nebula made out of gasses and matter, including H and He, but also C, Fe, O, etc... \n* Presumably a shockwave from a nearby supernova led to the collapse of this nebula, initiating the work of gravity to eventually lead to an accretion disc.\n\nSo my theory so far is the following: the solar nebula itself is made out of the remnants of supernovas from red giants that were formed in the early universe. The remnants happen to merge eventually into a big nebula. This would explain why the nebula contained traces of atoms other than H and He.\n\nSo... how far off am I? \n\nMany thanks in advance! \n\nKind greetings.",

At that distance New Horizons saw a sky ten times darker than the sky seen by the Hubble Space Telescope because of the absence of diffuse background sky brightness from the zodiacal light in the inner solarsystem. These measurements indicate that the total amount of light emitted by all galaxies at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths may be lower than previously thought. \n\n\nSo, my main question is this: now that we have the JWST working and the technique to put in a specific spot of space such delicate instruments, is it imaginable that in the next couple of decades it will be doable to put an even enhanced version of the JWST in the outer Solar System? I imagine data transfer would be an issue, for which we would need some sort of permanent stations on, for example, Jupiter, to receive and replicate information from so afar. I imagine those stations could also work studying Jupiter's atmosphere, for example. It's just fantasy, but I wanted to know if it's a reasonable, maybe long-term idea.\n\nThe Jupiter and Pluto images are so amazing. I can't sleep thinking that there's stuff made by us at 50 AU bringing information about a lot of unknown stuff that we know exists, but little we know about, although it's in our cosmic backyard.

If that is what smart ppl mean, how is it that humans can see more? \n\n2. Does the tech improve each day or year or something and than that is why humans can see more?  Do they use these tech and check the infinite univerrese every year and something?  Do  they have a calendar set up or something that reminds them to check whats going on in the  infinite univerrese every year - to check the total size of univerrese \n\n3. And the tech sees all this big stuff and then puts a number on it and says 'ok this is the total value and total of the univerrese' - of what humans can see currently\n\nI guess those smart ppl mean it's a infinite univerrese when they say that - what humans can see is 'expanding'\n\n1. What about galaxies what basically counts as a galaxy, like galaxyies can very very close to each other, cant they?\n\n1. Say that humans had the tech to go to next nearest galaxyies and then next -- very very fast. The galaxyies  could be close to each and it'll be fine yea? There won't be any major negative effects  of galaxyies being very close together yea?\n\n1. What does it mean when physist ppl wonder whats the 'shape' of the univerrese. If the Infinite univerrese is infinite, how could there be a shape?\n\n1. Isn't good enough to know that the univerrese is 3d? \n\n\n1. What significant difference does or would it make if the Infinite univerrese was infiinite or was not? \n\n\n\nWhat's good video or summary of all this stuff and topic of Infinite univerrese?\n\nMaybe a well made site that has like a few clear lines for each \n\n- And it's in faq style with q&amp;a\n\n- And you can click on the next question if you're interested to show the science info \n\n- And if you aren't you can just go to the next question, and click that one\n\nDo you know of any good well made sites like this? -- that has been made yet that covers this topic of infinite univerrese?\n\n\nVisuals are definitely neeeded \n\nWhat's a good video or good summary you seen on topic of universe, infinite univerrese",

            "what is a good video or good summary you seen on topic of universe infinite univerrese like when a youtuber says univerrese is expanding i guess what they mean is that univerrese humans can see is like 50 but it is what humans can see that is expanding maybe univerrese will expand to 1500 later on so now humans can see more of the infinite univerrese 1 if that is what smart people mean how is it that humans can see more",

By helping to restore this fishpond I was reconnecting with the ways of my ancestors, while also developing leadership skills as a Boy Scout. This is how I was being a Boy Scout in a Hawaiian cultural lens.\u201d\n\nHe attended Kamehameha Schools Kap\u0101lama in Honolulu, one of the campuses of a Hawaiian private school system incorporating both academic excellence and a focus on Hawaiian history and culture. After graduating he started college in pursuit of a degree in physics and mathematics. At the same time, he worked several jobs\u2014at Macaroni Grill, at Nico\u2019s Pier 38, and tutoring with UAchieve and in the math department at the University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa\u2014to help support his family.\n\n....\n\nAnd he realized that things he had been taught about the TMT through the bridge program were flawed, including claims such as that the TMT would harm the island\u2019s water supply, that it would be environmentally damaging, that astronomy is \u201cbig business\u201d and, akin to a commercial development, was motivated by financial greed. \u201cI already have friends in grad school that have job offers outside of astronomy for half a million dollars a year.

The Sun always rises in the east at 05:00 and sets in the west at 22:12, leaving 17 hours 12 minutes of sunlight to 6 hours 48 minutes of darkness per day. I don't have information on the Moon yet.\n\nCould someone point me to what missing pieces I need to gather to pinpoint eclipses, and what kind of mathematical formula I'm looking for? Thank you in advance.",

What if I took one of my portrait lenses 90mm f/2 (135mm FFE) and tried to get a shot of Andromeda. Obviously I didn't want star trails and this seems to be the sweet spot for exposure/iso vs. narrow field of view......I'm hooked. I got such a rush from the mediocre picture haha.    \n\n\nI was a teacher for 10 years, but recently resigned and am now a full time photographer. At the school I had access to a  Meade 8\" LX200 ACF and I do miss using it, but I never used it for Astro-Photography. So here is my question.   \n\n\nAs a photographer I have access to some really nice glass. From 18mm f/1.8 to 600mm f/8 (wildlife lens) Lot's of prime lenses and such.   \n\n\nI have about $1000 budget. Should I go towards a Star-tracker and use the glass I already have (Fuji XF) or invest in a proper telescope and adapt to that? That is to say, is a $1000 telescope as good as photography glass  with a star tracker to get started.   \n\n\nThe goal is to save up and maybe get a nice telescope, but got to make sure my little girl can so soccer first haha.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mla122h12l91.jpg?width=6240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=feca669869cd69a8a9f4f64445846a051d212dbd",

Teach hasn't given us a ton of guidelines for our observing project, so I'm trying to get some opinions on the scope of my project. I'm currently looking into studying an Algol type eclipsing binary system called V342 Aquilae (catchy ik). It's a super interesting system in all respects, but for my project I will have to convince a panel to give me telescope time and I'm wondering what reasons are usually good for this? It seems it's a really understudied system, all of its parameters were determined in the 90s and it doesn't look like they've been touched since. But I think remeasuring all of these is too wide of a scope for a one semester class. If anyone has time to learn a little about the star and let me know a \"why?\" and \"what?\" you think would be a good thing to use for my project please lmk in the comments!

Here is what I normally do: \n\nPlace telescope on flat/level ground. \n\nMake sure that it is pointing north and that the telescope is horizontal to the ground. \n\nPut in the date, time and my location. \n\nSelect which region of sky I am in. \n\nPick the first star and align the scope to it. \n\nThen the telescope will move to the next star but will be completely off by massive margins, like on the complete opposite side of the sky.

Also worth mentioning we are in a scientific school specialized in chemistry, but it's not the main interest of most students, so I wouldn't count on it, and the club would be held by our geography professor, so I don't think she knows a lot about physics anyway...\n\nCould anyone give me with any suggestion for a program? My first idea was about orientation in the night sky, understanding where planets are, moon phases to understand at which point of the month you are, knowing how to recognize some basic constellations, bright stars etc, this would be the first unity. I know it's a lot of stuff but we can't go too much into detail since we are limited to 1 hour a week and we can't focus on only one unity for the whole year... So, what next? I believe I need to suggest at least 3/4 good unities...\n\nI was thinking that learning about galaxies types, star types, DSO, black holes etc would be interesting, but I'm not sure how to make it all work together, connect it, also making it easy to explain by a geography professor and interesting for students (I'm afdaid students could get overwhelmed by a lot of theory they can't see and completely understand, thus making them bored).\n\nAny idea?\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if we would be allowed to go to the planetarium here and there, but maybe \\*just maybe\\* we could go to the school roof when it's dark, but most probably not (around 7:30PM) (school here is both in the morning and evening, changing every other week)",

        "selftext": "This is something I\u2019ve been mulling over lately that I\u2019d like your guy\u2019s opinion on. So we humans understand that everything in the universe has to come from something. Something can\u2019t come from nothing. Everything that exists had to be caused by something else before it. For example, the universe was caused by the big bang, the universe cam from the big bang. \n\nBut I ask what caused the big bang? The problem with this is the standard law of cause and effect wouldn\u2019t apply since there was no concept of time before the bb. \n\nSo basically what I\u2019m trying to say is what ever created the initial singularity (If something did) wouldn\u2019t abide by the laws cause and effect, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to need something that caused it, since that would imply that time exists which it didn\u2019t before the big bang. So this thing would have to exist beyond time itself, it doesn\u2019t need something to cause it\u2019s existence. We humans wouldn\u2019t be able to even fathom that, because we understand that everything has to come from something. \n\nSo the thing that caused the big bang was timeless and it was also spaceless. Since there was no space before the bb either. And if it\u2019s spaceless then it\u2019s also matter-less too, since matter takes up space. \n\nSo this thing is spaceless, matterless, and timeless. As for my last question what\u2019s the didn\u2019t between something that\u2019s timeless, matterless, and spaceless, and something that doesn\u2019t exist?",

        "selftext": "After watching [this](https://youtu.be/V_sR94Yuf68) Astrum video on using spot robots to explore the martian surface, I wanted to see what other think of this possibility. And to also share what I think some pros and cons would be.\n\nThe premise behind the video is how these robots could be the replacement for rovers with wheels. The wheels make traveling across terrain difficult and limited. The rovers also cannot help themselves as efficiently when faced with a problem, such as the opportunity rover having a rock sample crumble and block the port for depositing the samples into the internal compartments. Though they did solve this problem, it was a difficult feat to accomplish. Another problem with rovers is martian dust covering solar panels and limiting the power it can gather from the sun. \n\nSpot has shown that it can correct itself from falls, traverse loose and unstable terrain, and move much faster than a rover. They also would be more dependent on ai for traveling and wouldn't need as much guidance from earth which is hindered due to the delay of signals at that distance. Spot robots can work as teams to assess problems and possibly fix any issues one of the bots might have such as dust inside one of their parts or wiping dust off solar panels. Working as a unit would allow greater and more efficient exploration, sample collection, and possibly aid in building the first martian settlement. They would be able to travel in caves which rovers cannot access or map giving us a better idea of what's under the surface and what mars looks like when not faced with solar radiation since the cave could preserve these details. \n\nI think the spot rovers could be instrumental in colonization of mars. They could allow permanent settlements to exist before humans even step foot on the martian surface making it safer for human colonization of the red planet. \n\nI've heard some say the spot robots could be hindered by their complex design which could mean they fail more easily under the harsh conditions. Though I think the moving parts can be shrouded to limit dust in the joints, it still could be a possibility of failure. Though it could be possible that a team of spots could fix the issues if one of the bots has a failure like this. Power supply also could be an issue. The robots are smaller and wouldn't really be able to gather much solar energy unless they had large panels that extended passed the frame of the body. These robots also might use power faster and need a more efficient source to operate. I've heard talks of using nuclear batteries though I don't believe there are not any at a size which could be usable on these bots. Another idea might be a power station where the spot robots could recharge instead of carrying panels or a heavy battery. \n\nWould love to hear others thoughts on this concept. Is this the future of martian exploration or is this too complex and prone to failure? How do you think engineers will solve the shortcomings of these robots and what ramifications could this have on colonization of mars? Thank you for reading this far and hope you learned something or have some interesting input on the subject!",

I know that M Dwarf stars emit intense solar flares, which is thought to pose a potential problem for the emergence of life on planets that orbit them. But I was wondering if the life that might exist in the terminator region could be protected from these flares, simply by the angle that the photons would hit the atmosphere, make it so that those higher energy wavelengths would be filtered out. These terminator regions would basically be in a state of perpetual sunset.  During evening on Earth, only the longer wavelengths reach us, and we aren't exposed to much (if any?) UV.

I barely have any physics in school, and when I do have it, it\u2019s things I already know from reading Stephen Hawking. I really don\u2019t have anything to do with these new interests of mine!!!\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here because maybe you have better ideas than me. What astronomy related things can I do at home, like for fun? A hobby?\n\nI\u2019ve been reading lots of books about astrophysics and physics in general, but I get so tired from school that I\u2019m sometimes too tired for reading. I\u2019d like to have something else too\n\nI know space observation, like telescopes, and astrophotography are two great ones but I don\u2019t have enough money to get a telescope. For the last months I\u2019ve been saving money to buy a Skywatcher heritage 130P but it\u2019s gonna take a couple months to get enough money, I\u2019ll be able to buy it in maybe January? \n\nSo, until January I basically don\u2019t have any space related things to do. Are there any space things I could do from home?? Thanks!",

But, I can't find this book on the web anymore, not on Amazon, and not in Sagan's bibliography on Wikipedia either. So now I'm wondering whether perhaps it wasn't Sagan but someone else. What I do remember very clearly though (and what made the book stand out), is that it did *not* take the usual line of explanation of presenting light, gravity, how gravity has a pull on light, and how therefore it's possible for gravity to be so strong that light can't escape. Instead, this book followed the line of reasoning that sufficient gravity can make a star collapse into a white dwarf, by \"breaking up\" the atoms into protons, electrons, and neutrons; and from that state, a further increase in gravity can \"solidify\" that entire soup into a neutron star, and a still further increase in gravity can lead to a collapse of the neutrons into... well, into \"nothing\", which would be an infinite collapse into a black hole.\n\nSOLVED: Isaac Asimov, \"The Collapsing Universe.

        "selftext": "Hi, I'm a 15 yo IB student from South Asia. I've loved astronomy for years and I always always wanted to do research in this field. I assumed this would be a good year to look for research opportunities for various reasons: I plan to base my extended essay (IB component) on physics + I want to have a real-time experience to see if I'm willing to dedicate the rest of my life to research. It would be best if I carried it out now/summer of 12th grade because I'll be occupied with IB exams and college apps next year (planning to go to the US for uni). In my country though, none of the local colleges offer astronomy, nor do we have many research programs running for high schoolers. The research programs online (like lumiere edu) are very very expensive and I can't join them. Currently, I'm looking at cold-emailing professors/postdocs/grad students. I'm very interested in cosmology, astrophysics and observational astronomy. It's just that, I don't know how exactly I can independently help/carry out research remotely (online). Also, I'm not sure how to go about this process because I don't know where to look, for postdocs/grad students (like should I look through LinkedIn or are there any other places).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have above-average grades and my physics teacher said I have excellent hs level research skills, and I can def explore them at a higher level. I really want to explore astronomy this way because everything seems so exciting- I love reading about others' research and hope to do the same one day. However, idk what's the best way to go about it/where I should start. \n\n Any tips or feedback would be much appreciated! Thank you.",

How can there be an unobservable universe? If my understanding is correct, the existence of the universe started with the Big Bang, which can be very vaguely explained as all matter and energy in a tiny space, suddenly ejected outwards. That ejection of matter is subject to the physical laws of the universe, so no travelling past C for any individual reference frame. How then can areas of the universe be invisible to us? If all matter was ejected at less than the speed of light, surely we would be able to see that matter flying away from the central big bang location? Admittedly, that light would be very very old once you get to the farthest points away, but it should still be there, right? Therefore there shouldn\u2019t be areas of the universe that are \u201cunobserved\u201d, but have millennia old photons that are only now arriving.\n\nVery possible that I\u2019m extrapolating my understanding wrong here, but is there any ELI5 kind of reasoning for the definition of the observable universe?",

I'm currently a senior Astrophysics and Mathematics double major, and I should've realized after even my intro astrophysics course back in freshman year felt like a chore, but I'm not sure even a math-based job is something I'd be good at or like, especially considering my motivation in my classes has always been really low, I'm just lucky enough to be naturally good at it.  I pass my classes with good grades, but as soon as it gets difficult at all I just give up, it's not something I'm ever interested in.\n\nThis is obviously very late to realize this, but there's been a lot happening in my personal life that led me to just say good enough on a lot of parts of my life, including my degree.  The isolation of the pandemic and a year of wild changes in my life has led to me fixing a lot of the personal stuff and really looking at my degree, and realizing how much I don't and haven't enjoyed astrophysics at a higher level than hobby.  It's all just work to get done, and I never indulge in astrophysics outside of school besides going to an observatory I have access to every couple of months.\n\nSorry for the very long intro, this is honestly not a depressing topic to me since it's been bugging me and I'm finally trying to solve it, but I wanted to make it clear it's not a problem with disliking education because quite frankly I love school, and the prospect of getting to teach is something that's kept me attached to astrophysics even if I didn't love learning it.\n\nWith all this said, I have a million hobbies that I take part in from painting to playing an instrument to cooking to decorating, and they're always very creative and things I tend to prioritize over my work most times even though I know I shouldn't.  It's clear I'm not being creatively fulfilled with astrophysics, and I understand there's creativity to research and teaching, but it's still very analytic.  The only time I've felt creatively fulfilled in an academic sense is in my music classes and computer science classes, but I feel like the creativity in most computer science jobs gets sucked away int he corporate sphere.\n\nThere's famously a large number of jobs open to STEM grads even outside of degrees that use the math you've learned, but I'm wondering if there's any fields (grad school welcome if needed) that like having STEM grads that leans more to the creative side of the spectrum? \n\nThank you for reading.  I'm not sure if Astronomy is a great place to post this and I'll probably find other places that might know more about jobs outside of astronomy to ask as well.",

It's orbital rotation largely leaves it in the presence of the star to allow the moon to remain habitable, only going out of the sun's view, blocked by the planet once during the planet's revolution which occurs once every 80 or so years, and lasts no longer than a few days.\n\nMy question stems from what I personally would think is the best set piece to be viewed in the sky, and I've come to the conclusion a deep blue ice giant similar to neptune may work best, but I need to know if there is enough plausibility for it to make sense from a scientific perspective.\n\nThe time frame for the revolution of the planet is not finalized btw. I don't actually know how long it would take a planet to orbit in the habitable zone of a system with a blue star, as the habitable zone would be much further out than it is around our own star, especially if the star itself was bigger than our own.",

Sci-fi movies are also on the table. Many of us have an amateur coding background. \nCurrently I believe stargazing will have to be an out of school/club time event, such as on the weekends.\n\nI really would like to learn in this, and I know many others want to learn as well, but I\u2019m not sure if creating lesson plans myself is a good idea. We have an astronomy class in our school so I would like to make this more relaxed and a place to connect with our fascination of the cosmos.  Our first meeting is next Wednesday, so I was thinking we could just brainstorm what we wanted to do together.  \n\nKind of running this on my own right now. Anything and everything for advice would be useful. Bit worried! Thank you. \u2606\n\n(btw how do i scare off the astrologer kids? they keep mixing it up\u2026)",

        "selftext": "Hi\n\nEdit: I have no idea why reddit has displayed that picture as the header to this, sorry if it confuses.\n\nI have a question about meteors. Here's what I have looked into:\n\nI have been googling the various meteor showers and learning about radiants. I learned that meteors that appear to come at you head on, directly from the radiant, may appear to have no tail and appear slow moving. I also read that there is a type of meteor known as a sporadic, which can be difficult to trace to its radiant.\n\nI recently saw some footage by pilots which is being claimed as a UFO sighting (yeah I know, please don't check out just yet!). They are slow moving point sources that appear to arc and apparently have a \"fizz\" around them. I want to see if it is more likely to be a meteor shower coming head on. The question comes up because it appears to be coming from near Merak, or in other footage generally from the big dipper, and I could not find a known shower with its radiant here after a good bit of googling. [This site](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Radiation_astronomy/Showers#Gamma_Ursae_Minorids) seemed fairly comprehensive.\n\nIts happening July to September, and I learned that the perseids are active at this time, but would generally be \"tailed\" meteors with their radiant in Perseus.\n\nIs it possible to get a sporadic perseid meteor that appears separated from its radiant in Perseus? Is there another meteor shower taking place around this time that could have no tail and appear near the bottom right hand corner of the Big Dipper? Were \"no-radiant\" or tail-less meteors common in 2022 from June to late September, visible from Japan to the West Coast of the US and to the North?\n\nI saw that there is the Gamma Ursa Minorids and the Ursids which have the right area as their origin, but this does not match the time frame of the observations.\n\nThe author provides a compilation of clips from 17:32 in [this video](https://youtu.be/lfB7LSaOMdc?t=1052). There are other clips with times and dates mentioned in there too but this part at least shows the location of the big dipper.\n\nAt [22:30](https://youtu.be/lfB7LSaOMdc?t=1348) he shows what I think could be the meteor head on, with the sparks he mentions being the tail of the meteor behind the main body, mostly obscured.\n\nHopefully this is permissible as I am trying to find an astronomical explanation of a sighting?",

We are still in the initial phase and for now I'm trying to figure out how much time it takes for satellites of this size to passively decay due to aerodynamic drag, from LEO.\n\nI first wanted to do the calculations by hand and then use a software like STK to validate them. I'm having a few issues. From here, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_decay i was trying to use the equation for dR/dt in excel to calculate the amount of time for the cubesat to decay, ie, reach an altitude smaller or equal to 180 km.\nThe way i did it was by simply integrating dR with respect to time and then plotting it in excel using the data for the different altitudes (density, orbital speed,  orbital period, etc).\nThe results I'm getting make absolutely no sense and I checked the steps multiple times so i believe it's just that my method is wrong. \n\nCould anyone suggest what I'm doing wrong and what would be a better method to do this? I'm not that great with python but i can try to use it if it makes the whole process easier.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Could you illuminate the surface artifically and thus get rid of at least one variable being the intensity and position of the sun. It just seemed disproportionately sensitive to disturbances to me.

But I'm sure Mercury and Venus and the asteroid belt, etc are all, semantically speaking, extraterrestrial. (Not sure about the sun.)\n\nThis is based on the assumption we're not alone in the universe, so this isn't an absurd hypothetical nor pseudo-science. I'm just wondering about terminology.\n\n**Main Point**:\n\nSo, if we found \"aliens\", no matter what, they're extraterrestrials. But... I'm sure most people think aliens only exist or could exist outside of our Solar system. And I'm sure there's a classification system within SETI concerning them. They might have terms for interstellar aliens and intergalactic aliens. So, an alien in the Milky Way would be an interstellar alien civilization. (But not quite. I will further elaborate here later.) If they exist outside of the Milky Way, they're intergalactic aliens. But, what if we found life within our own star system? Like, let's say they could exist on Venus or even Mars (this includes fossils of extinct aliens, even small organisms), or a moon of Jupiter's, etc. \n\nDoes SETI have a term for them (their possibility)? Such as intra-stellar or intra-solar extraterrestrials? (Or maybe even Solar extraterrestrials?)\n\nAlso, what if we find them on a moon to a planet and nit the planet, outside of Sol's system? Does that have a term? (Obv \"lunar\" wouldn't work. But what's the term for anything found on a moon? Also, I don't think an adjective form of satellite would work either, since planets are satellites too; and thus wouldn't be descriptive enough.) Like \"extra-solar extraterrestrial planetary life\" and \"extra-solar extraterrestrial moon-life\". What would life on a moon be called?\n\n(Also, \"extra-solar intra-galactic life\" could work for life in another star system. And I assume life on multiple plants within the same stellar system could be based off the name we've given the planet.)\n\nNow, when jt comes to civilizations on a particular planet within the Milky Way, I'm sure they'd have a basic technical term (extra-solar) and a name based on the specific star and planet. But when jt comes to possible aliens in, say, Andromeda, I'm sure that'd not really be so important quite yet.\n\n**  This is something I'm truly curious about, bht obv doesn't truly matter I suppose. Jts just terminology I'm wondering about. Bht I'd like to know if places that look for life that isn't on earth have certain terms and if so, I'd like to know the terms.",

That's why, to see their star maps and such, astronomers instead use little red lights, which preserve rather than ruin night vision, since the rods on the retina don't really see red.\n\nOkay great! The above is well understood and settled. But now my question! What about green laser pointers? How do those impact night vision? I haven't been able to find anything specifically linking green laser pointers to night vision, either way. Surely somebody out there in Astronomy Land must know.

So, I have been debating for a while whether or not to post about this, but finally decided to do so since it is something I am kind of passionate about and this sub-redit seems the closest to the topic matter of the movement of the sun throughout the sky and how it changes based on the latitude of the observer.\n\nAs I am sure many reading this are already familiar with, we have graphs online charting day, night, and the three stages of twilight in-between (Civil, Nautical, and Astronomical; being when the sun is below the horizon, but still close enough to affect the night sky in some way. Also, if you don't know what I am talking about, here is a source you can visit to show you what the graph looks like where you live: https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/)\n\nIt got me to thinking though, what about tracking the Sun's position above the horizon? See, I work night shift 18:30-05:00 and live a little over \u00bc\u00b0  east of my work, so some times throughout the year I get these breathtaking sunrises and sunsets, but other times throughout the year are a major nuisance since the Sun is about to set or has just risen and, as such, is *very* close to the horizon. I drive a narrow 2 lane road (1 lane in each direction,) so this mildly stresses me out.\nGraphs like the ones I mentioned above are great for telling what time of year I would be getting the breathtaking sunrises and sunsets, but lack the ability to visually show me when the sun poses the most of a hazard just before or just after setting . . . So it got me thinking . . . What would that graph look like if you partitioned *Degrees of Day* similar to how you partition stages of twilight, in essence, extending the graph? Obviously, it wouldn't really make since to extend the night portion, as there is really no differance to the observer when the Sun's position 20\u00b0 below the horizon vs. 80\u00b0 below the horizon . . . But during the day, there is a very noticeable difference between 20\u00b0 &amp; 80\u00b0 above the horizon . . . So I set about making some graphs differentiating what I refer to as \"Degrees of Day.\" I decided to divide the sky into 12 parts and made several graphs showcasing this by using different latitudes at the prime meridian to basiclly show how Local Mean Time changes depending on latitude. \nI thought about adding them in here, but am unsure if it would be violating the group rules, so for now I will abstain.

Based on the apparent exponential decay of its period, the two stars were predicted to merge in early 2022 resulting in a rare red nova outburst. Fortunately KIC 9832227 was observed in 2003 as part of the NASA Ames pre-Kepler Vulcan Project to search for transiting exoplanets. We find that the Vulcan timing measurement does not agree with the previous exponential decay model. This led us to re-evaluate the other early epoch non-Kepler data sets, the Northern Sky Variability Survey (NSVS) and Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) survey. We find that the WASP times are in good agreement with the previous prediction, but the NSVS eclipse time differs by nearly an hour. The very large disagreement of the Vulcan and NSVS eclipse times with an exponentially decaying model forces us to reject the merger hypothesis. Although period variations are common in contact binaries, the physical cause of the period changes in KIC 9832227 remains unexplained; a third star scenario is unlikely. This study shows the data collected by the Vulcan photometer to be extremely valuable for extending the baseline for measurements of variable stars in the Kepler field.  \n[source](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...864L..32S/abstract)",

You will be surprised at how much you can see even with all the light pollution around you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live in a bright downtown area.\n\nLike.. very downtown. Think skyscrapers and neon signs everywhere.\n\nOver the years I had heard so many people complain about city lights and light pollution and how we have lost the night sky and all that depressing stuff, both in person and on the internet, that I never bothered to find or identify things in the sky. I never even looked at the sky much.\n\nIn July 2022, the first JWST images just happened to drop on the same day as Amazon's Prime Day, and I impulse bought a pair of 20x80 astronomy binoculars on sale and a tripod.\n\nI went in completely blind about how to find things in the sky. I'm learning as I go with the Stellarium app.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMostly looking south, east and above from my rooftop, (there's taller buildings and way more light pollution towards N and W), and off the top of my head, here's all the things I have seen and learned in the last 3 months:\n\n* Incredible detail on the moon. The craters cast shadows and that shows even more detail, especially along the edge between light and dark. There's something new to see every night as the moon goes through its phases and there are shadows in new places.\n* Jupiter and its four biggest moons. It looks like a big bright disk. The moons are dots along a roughly straight line and they change positions every night. Jupiter happened to be at opposition last month.\n* Saturn, also at opposition a month earlier. It also looks like a bright disk, but much smaller. It looks yellowish. The rings look like bulges. It's clearly not circular. Titan is also visible. It also changes location over days.\n* Mars started as a bright point (clearly red-orangeish), but has since grown into a small disk and I am looking forward to opposition in December when it will be bigger.\n* Uranus and Neptune, both points. Uranus looks slightly pale blueish.\n* The Pleiadas. They are clearly blue and I can see 50+ stars in there.\n* Core of the Andromeda Galaxy. It looks like a fuzzy white oval patch.\n* Hyades, Mirfak's surroundings, Double cluster in Perseus, and many other dense spots in the sky I see all the time but don't know the names of yet.\n* Many, many double stars. Many, many stars everywhere in general. Blue and yellow ones stand out. If a star is shown on the Stellarium app all zoomed in (at max zoom at free tier), I can see it in the binoculars.\n\nUsing the app, I have learned how to find constellations like Cassiopeia, Andromeda, Aries, Perseus and Cygnus in the sky. Under these conditions, many constellations have missing stars and many are completely invisible to the naked eye. so I also got a 8x42 roof for finding them. Surprisingly, these show me faint objects like the Andromeda Galaxy as well, just much less zoomed in.\n\nThings that are not visible: The Milky way, Triangulum galaxy, any nebula, any other cloudy M or NGC objects, any colors except on bright planets and stars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I can see all of the things above from the middle of a very bright downtown area in only 3 months and looking only South and East, **imagine how much more you can see** from where you are in one year.\n\n**Don't let the city lights discourage you**.

I know Starlink and the forthcoming mega constellations have caused harm and hampered observations in a large way, but I am wondering if there might be a possible unintended use for the ground stations....  \n\nHas anyone investigated if you could use the ground stations (dishes) from these mega constellations (starlink and possibly similar ones in the future) that are equipped with phased array antennas to build something that might be equivalent to the [VLBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Long_Baseline_Array) (Very Long Baseline Array), just with FAR more observatories?  \n\nIt seems like the signal filtering and anti-interference capabilities of these units are first class.  The amount of geography covered is basically the face of the earth.  All units have good time synchronization, built in GPS (for self reporting of position and orientation), and the ability to phone the data back home relatively quickly.  \n\nIt appears the radios are 10+ ghz so I am not sure on the scientific usefulness for the spectrum(s) that they would be able to monitor.

Was in not necessary to measure the distances to these Cepheid stars in some other way in order to confirm and/or calibrate this theory?\n2. If #1 is true how was that done back in the early 1900's?  Parallax?   I thought stars are too far away to use parallax even if observations are done 6 months apart so as to use the diameter of earth's obit around the sun as the triangular base.  Are some Cepheid variables close enough to use parallax even with early 1900's tech?\n3. When Edwin Hubble used Cepheid variable stars to estimate the distance from Earth to the Andromeda \"Nebula\" as it was called prior, how could Hubble know that said Cepheid variable stars were actually within Andromeda and not between Earth and Andromeda or behind Andromeda perhaps by many light years?  In other words how could Hubble be sure that from the line of sight from Earth to Andromeda that these Cepheid stars didn't just appear to be within Andromeda?\n4. How was luminosity of stars measured in Henrietta Leavitt's day.  Apparent luminosity or otherwise.   Eyeball estimates?  Photographic plates?  I would imagine the latter, but how was that quantified back then when there were no CCD sensors?",

        "selftext": "I have read several articles over the last few years wherein astronomers of various stripes bemoan the reflected light coming from Starlink satellites - they often don't complain about any other satellites. They use terms like \"existential threat\" and \"catastrophe\" among other hyperbolic comments to suggest the consequences of these motion artifacts are insurmountable except to stop the launch of future Starlink satellites. \n\nAs a lover of astronomy, science, and photography, I am struck by the lack of creativity regarding the potential solutions to this problem. The easiest one that comes to my mind is simply filtering moving objects from the resulting image. As I understand the process of  image data acquisition of professional and amateur telescopes alike, they acquire their images over time either as a single, long, tracked exposure or as an aligned stack of multiple images. Software in use today removes these types of artifact - the streaks of orbiting satellites are subtracted from the static background.

Review request.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nHi! This is my first ever post on here so forgive my current lack of lingo etc.. (long time listener first time caller situation) I wanted to put this out to the Astronomy community and get honest feedback.\n\nIn 2016 my friend Nathan and I wrote a book together. For background he is an PHD and Astrophysicist with a big brain for the universe and I am a comedian and writer. Together we wrote a new version of the night sky based on southern culture and folklore. The entire approach to stargazing was re-written and honestly it makes looking up at night easy for anyone and fun. We mapped entirely new constellations over the course of a year plus. New asterisms followed that mapping and the stories that put them there. Out with the Greek stuff and in with the \"dip-cup, y'all\"  stuff. Once that was done we then had to create new astrology to meet the needs of the new southern version of stars in the sky.\n\nI will be happy to send a free copy link to anyone that wants to review it for me/us. I am planning an expansion of this IP and new world we created but would like more opinions of the current work before growing/altering what comes next.\n\nThe overview of the book is here: [https://books.apple.com/us/book/nate-and-brads-guide-to-stars-in-the-southern-sky/id1172005379](https://books.apple.com/us/book/nate-and-brads-guide-to-stars-in-the-southern-sky/id1172005379)\n\nThere are few screen grabs so you can see some of what we did.\n\nWould love anyone's thoughts.\n\nThank you!",

The eyepiece lens will be a regular 25mm eyepiece lens from amazon.\n\nAs for the objective lens, I was hoping to find a double convex lens with a diameter of 50mm, and a focal length of 500mm. However, due to time constraints, I'm finding it difficult to find one available for delivery soon enough. I've found one with a 100mm focal length, would that be too short to create a telescope with? Would it result in a really short telescope, more like a monocular? And if so, is it possible to make one with multiple lenses?\n\nThanks for any help :)",

For this discussion, let us pick out stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes.\n\nAs we know, slipping past the event horizon of a black hole means an object (light too) is at a point of no return and subject to the tidal effect caused by a black hole's immense gravitational force the said object will be \"spaghettified\".\n\nThat being said, I always felt that it's the smaller black holes that are far more dangerous. Their event horizons are smaller, and by virtue of their size they are also immensely dense (simple math). With supermassive black holes, the event horizons are massive and thus it is also more likely that one could stay there for longer than they could on the event horizons of much smaller black holes.\n\nHowever, I recently read an article that explains very precisely why this is the case. It is due to the tidal force exerted by a given black hole. The difference in the force exerted on one's head and the force exerted on one's feet will be much larger in smaller black holes than they are in larger ones. And as I mentioned already that spaghettification depends on the tidal effect, you will get much more \"spaghettified\" by a smaller black hole. \n\n\nJust sharing something that I have found to be really fascinating ever since I started majoring in astrophysics 4 years ago. \ud83d\ude04",

Now, I have convinced myself that since we have units the data must have gone through photometric calibration and represents real world radiance, hence exposure should be a non-issue, but the 'per Hz' part of the units makes me unsure whether I need to do any relative scaling of pixel values between different bandwidth filters. In other words - is the pixel value ment to mean X/bw and be scaled by the integral of throughput, or is it already scaled and then I have no idea why it's in spectral units.\n\nI'm really only interested in being able to sum values from multiple filter bands and be sure that filter bandwidth and throughput is properly taken care of.

I really wanted to he an astrophysicist as a kid, but my parents sat me down one night and told me I was too stupid to do it, and so I gave up on that dream long ago. Now I\u2019m an animation major in college, but I\u2019m about to fail the first basic Astronomy class for the second time now, and all I can say is that Astronomy has now become one of my least favorite subjects. I can\u2019t seem to wrap my brain around the math, and I\u2019m routinely struggling with the material. I\u2019m almost willing to try tutoring, but I feel like tutoring is cheating and it just means I\u2019m too stupid to understand the material. I don\u2019t know what to do. I haven\u2019t taken any math or physics in 5 years, so every time someone whips out almost any math I am really really lost. I don\u2019t remember any geography/trig. I only took pre-calc in high school but I sucked at that, and now I suck at this. I hate the fact that my experience with the subject has caused me to hate something I used to love. I need academic resources or something, because I\u2019m failing to understand how to do Hubble\u2019s Law, and Standard Candles still makes no sense after 3 YouTube videos and listening in class and looking at the textbook. Help?\n\nEdit: Wow, I was not expecting this much support, I really appreciate all of you guys that took the time to read and respond. That said, I am definitely going to go get some tutoring today if I can. I never really used a tutor before because it felt like it meant I wasn\u2019t good enough, but I can see now that is an unhealthy mindset. I\u2019ve been in a really bad place mentally this semester, and struggling with this class has really messed with my self esteem. I really don\u2019t want to lose my love for space, so I\u2019m glad to see so many ideas for other ways to pursue that hobby without having to get a Masters Degree.

The shape was diffuse and quite large, like an actual ball of fire in the sky.

The cluster width spread across the majority (70%-80%) of my field of view through the eyepiece. The cluster was not a line, or circle, or any specific shape, it was somewhat similar to the Pleiades. They were in and out of my view in under a second and were a whiteish-blue color, each being similar to the size Jupiter would have been under the same magnification and they all had a haze/trail around them. I immediately pulled back from the telescope and looked up with my bare eyes and could see nothing. I then pulled up stellarium to see if it could have been the ISS or a Satelite but stellarium showed nothing. I then pulled up flight tracker and ensured there were no planes in the area.

Boy was I wrong.\n\nSo, this is kind of last resort: I found that most projectors that use lasers actually use them to project some kind of kaleidoscopic \"stars\", that aren't even randomized, let alone accurate. Others use a kind of \"slides\" they project onto a wall or ceiling, problem is they are just photos so... yeah. 60's tech. I mean, it sounds cheaper to buy pocket laser projector, attach it to a Raspberry Pi and you can display whatever you want.\n\nIs that an accurate assessment, or have I missed some good product?",

Interestingly, somebody told me they saw a shooting star behind me, through the back glass of my car, while we were on a zoom call recently. I dismissed it as some kind of glare because it seemed absurd to me that somebody would be able to see a meteor on a small screen through my back windshield in a brightly lit parking lot.

        "selftext": "This is my 3rd post on this sub, so I'm sure some of you already know about this. I've posted this question in mathematics groups looking for an answer but so far I haven't had anyone accept the challenge to help me. So if there is anyone in here who knows advanced math to calculate a new trajectory, I'd love to hear from you.\n\nThe Background: First, let me fill you in on what I'm working on. I'm currently developing a new PC Strategy game in which you are an alien species from the Sirius star system out there exploring the galaxy. I wanted to make it an alien species, so you will eventually encounter humans on your journey. Mostly, the game will be about exploration and solving scenarios encountered along the way. \n\nThe setup: So to make everything even more accurate, I pulled all the actual star chart data for our local stellar neighborhood. Every star within 40 light years away will be a place you can visit in the game. The game will be designed to take into account distances for travel and communications. Communications traveling at the speed of light and depending on your upgrades to the ship, knowing the distance and your ship's speed capability will allow the game to accurately present the in-game time it would take to do what you set out to do. So with that in mind, I had to figure out not only the distance from our star to other stars but also the distance from star X to star Y. \n\nI was able to do this through some formulas set up in a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet takes the star's degrees/hours, minutes, and seconds and converts it into the star's Right Ascension and Declination, and using that plus the distance, the spreadsheet calculates the star's Cartesian coordinates and then uses those to figure out the distance from one star to another. That part works very well and that math is already done.\n\nWhat's in a name: While working on the storyline, I realized that an alien species would not be using earth names for stars. If you were a highly organized, space-traveling alien species, how would you name your stars?  If it were me, I would make them addresses instead. So what is known as Alpha Centauri here would be known as star 219.902 | -60.834 | 4.3441. The star's Right Ascension, Declination, and distance from the home star would be a perfect addressing system for the stars.\n\nThe Problem: Some of you may have already noticed the problem with this. If I'm an alien species, with my home star being Sirius, then why are all my addresses calculated using Sol as the home star? So what I need help with, is I need to know the formula to enter into my spreadsheet to convert Earth data into Sirian data. It's a triangle, right? A huge space triangle. I know the direction and the distance of two lines leaving our sun. Those are two sides of a triangle. The math I already did gives me the length of that third line. Now I need to know the angle at which that line exits Sirius. \n\nI need a formula that will give me the Right Ascension and declination of any given star, from the home star of Sirius. Attached you will find a sample of the spreadsheet showing the data for Sirius, Sol, and Alpha Centauri. Obviously, right now, Sol is all zeros because it's the home star. You can use this data to test the formula and make Sirius all zeros instead. If it works for these 3 stars, it should work for all 500+ stars on my spreadsheet.",

        "selftext": "Long story short, I found many exoplanets that are in the habitable zone, but none that are earth like going around a sun-like star. So I switched my search towards the stars that might have undiscovered planets.\n\nI am looking for not only habitable planets, but planets that would be similar to earth. And for that I couldn't find any lists that would have the same requirements as I do.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRequirements for the star:\n\nDistance: up to 100ly\n\nAge: 2Gyr or more\n\nBinary: No binary star within 1000 AU\n\nPlanets: no hot giants, no strings of Neptunes\n\nMetallicity: 50% or more\n\nSpectral type F8 - G8\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation:\n\nDistance: as close as possible obviously. Considering that there are only about 1000 KGF type stars within 100ly that should give me a few habitable exoplanets somewhere there. So I'm aiming for 20 - 70ly\n\nAge: I want intelligent life, not just bacteria, so I need to copy earth. I need billions of years for an oxygen atmosphere and for evolution.\n\nClose binary stars make any planetary orbits unstable. That no bueno considering how delicate my system is.\n\nPlanets: So this is the part that most people ignore. If I understand correctly, most planets migrate toward their star. The reason why Jupiter didn't is because Saturn and sequentially neptune stopped the movement due to their orbital resonance [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPouwOKMS2s&amp;ab\\_channel=Dr.Becky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPouwOKMS2s&amp;ab_channel=Dr.Becky) I assume this is only possible because two gas giants is a very rare phenomenon and it only happened because Saturn is big enough to do that.\n\nMost planets are like mini Neptunes, which happens when there's not enough material to create a Jupiter size planet that would clear out the mini neptunes and leave behind an anulus of rocky material to form terrestrial planets. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm7poMupE8k&amp;t=1982s&amp;ab\\_channel=LexFridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm7poMupE8k&amp;t=1982s&amp;ab_channel=LexFridman)\n\nMetallicity: following the planet forming logic, I need more material in the disk and more metal-rich material. So high metallicity indicates that there might be a more massive disk since it is a population I star (more material in the star forming region) and it will form more massive rocky cores that will attract more water/methane and more H/He afterwards creating a Jupiter size giant. Also that would leave behind more massive terrestrial planets after Jupiter's migration.\n\nSpectral type: again, following the planet forming logic I need more mass to create a large disk that will not only create a two gas giants but also some leftover terrestrial planets. Thus small K type stars are not good enough, also larger stars are just to short-lived for life so F8 is max. Not that K stars couldn't have theses kind of planets, but I would think that would be less likely, and I want the highest likelihood.",

            "i am using a telescope to track satellites and the output from our imaging camera is fits i have a few fits viewers but none do all the things i need i am looking for a fits image viewer that will take a large set of fits images and turn them into a video allow me to determine the centroid of a given object in the images will measure the fwhm of an object in the image to get an estimate of the seeing i am trying to analyze tracking performance of the telescope as it tracks satellites and the observing sessions can generate thousands of fits images ideally i would want a fits viewer that would allow me to quickly process these images to get the motion of the centroid of the satellite over the field of view during the observation",

I've come across the python package skyfield (https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/) which seems to be well put-together, but I'm not sure if there's something better or which could be considered the standard.

This means while some of my technical knowledge is really good, I have a lot of holes in my knowledge especially with relativity. \n\nA student asked me this question when I was describing how the escape velocity of the event horizon of a black hole is higher than the speed of light. It stopped me dead in my tracks because I had the same question and I had no answer. If gravity acts on matter, why is light, energy, trapped? \n\nI consulted a few websites and I think I understand but I\u2019m still not totally comfortable with the concept. Here\u2019s an answer as I currently understand it: \n\nBecause black holes are so massive, they bend space time moreso than other celestial bodies. This warping of space time is what doesn\u2019t allow light to pass the event horizon.  \n\nThat\u2019s about the depth I can currently give. Is this a sufficient answer?

        "selftext": "Hi, a new-again astronomer here, rediscovering the hobby after 20 years... and with what I'm sure is a newbie question:\n\nWhat is the effective difference that field of view makes, when considering two different eyepieces of the same type (Plossl, etc) and that have the same focal length? What difference does FOV make, i.e. is a wider FOV always better or under what circumstance would you want a narrower FOV?\n\nFor example, I currently have a [Celestron Powerseeker 60az](https://www.amazon.com/Celestron-21041-60mm-PowerSeeker-Telescope/dp/B0002CTZAC) with a focal length of 700mm, am upgrading to a 90mm refractor soon, and am considering purchasing a 6mm eyepiece in anticipation of this. These two seem very similar, except one has a wider FOV. How will this affect my viewing (and recognizing that this eyepiece will likely be a little overpowered for my current telescope, though technically just below the theoretical maximum of a 60mm/700mm scope).\n\n[Goldline 6mm Plossl](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JWDFMZ4/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A1KTPYXLG45C22&amp;psc=1)\n\n[Non-Goldline 6mm Plossl](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CKPVCL8/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A1KTPYXLG45C22&amp;psc=1)\n\nWhat other differences are there to take note of, when considering two otherwise similar eyepieces? One of these is cheaper, but I'm presuming that's for a good reason... and recognizing these are both quite cheap, anyway.\n\nThanks so much!",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am just recently getting interested in astrophotography after trying a few experiments photographing the Orion constellation. I want to get a night sky application (preferrably desktop) so I can learn the positions of constellations and just generally explore the night sky when I'm in the city and don't have a great view. I know I had a program like this at one point, but I can't remember what it was.\n\nI remembered a long time (maybe 8 or 10 years ago) I found a program that let you explore the universe and various astronomical objects. It was free and very high quality, but I can't remember the name of it at all. I've been searching\n\nOne particular feature that I remember very well was the constellation highlighter. When you were near earth and turned it on, most everything looked normal. But as you zoomed waaaay out, the constellations would distort a ton because they look totally different from different angles. Our constellations link stars together that are sometimes incredibly far apart, and it gives this weird spiky appearance. The red dot in the center of my drawing is where our solar system would be.\n\nAll of my searches so far just pull up iphone apps, or celestron's starry night software. I was wondering if any of you all either knew what this program was or had a recommendation for a better one.\n\nAlso, I have found the applications Stellarium and also Gaia Sky. Neither of them were the program I used to have.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm almost certain I found the program I had as a kid.

        "selftext": "**TLDR**\n\nHow do frequently travelling astronomers protect their telescopes in transit? \n\n**Longer Tale**\n\nPossibly a strange note, but I've been dragging a Celestron 6E around SE Asia with me as I try to become a better astronomer (and lay groundwork for a hopeful PhD). My travel profile is I generally move a carry-on backpack, check-in duffel bag, and the oversized telescope box to a place for 1-3 months. So, was just in Bali, Japan, now in South of Thailand. Furure plans include S Africa and South America (and possibly japan again)\n\nHere's the issue: I've been repacking the telescope and mount in the rather excellent box and padding it came in, but on this most recent flight, the box got left out in the rain and the cardboard got quite soggy (as well as I am not sure anyone paid attention to the fragile and oversize nature). \n\nSince I'm thinking of spending the next year bopping around the globe I need a better solution for airline transportation (to say nothing of the looks it gets when I'm telling check-in its fragile, whacking stickers and note son it in various languages as to it being fragile and then crossig my fingers for it at oversize drop-off).\n\nWhat has worked for more mobile astronomers? I have a nice padded tube bag for it I could use (and maybe do carry-on with it and the other bag) and perhaps just put the mount and electronics in the duffel, but quite curious if anyone has a good solution for frequent international travel with this telescope and something that's really worked for them, I'd love to hear it. \n\nThanks for any helpful replies in advance. Quite curious what other people may have done or solutions that may exist that I have not seen. Sure I can't be the first person to try something so foolish... =\\]",

It's not the bins moving, its me, I'm standing trying to look through them awkwardly on a tripod trying to not touch them.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here? I am determined to enjoy them &amp; get the most out of them.\n\nCould it be the fact that the moon is almost full &amp; bright at the moment?\n\nCould it be the fact that I'm using budget tripod &amp; monopod &amp; a more expensive one would help?\n\nOr could it be that I need to find a way to sit down &amp; use them?\n\nI'd love to know\n\nPerhaps my first set shouldn't of been such high magnification at 20x, or maybe i picked up the wrong pair? I done a fair bit of research prior to buying them, from the review [Here](http://binocularsky.com/reviews/Pentax_SP_20x60.pdf) they looked amazing for stargazing.\n\nBut all I get is a tiny dot star wobbling around furiously &amp; can barely see anything :/",

Any help or recommendations on what to do would be brilliant!\n\nFinding the moon isn\u2019t too much trouble, but I\u2019d like to have the finderscope for assistance when I move on to searching for planets like Saturn and Mars and all that so I don\u2019t die of old age while fruitlessly looking for em.

I think that this makes very little sense and is at best irrelevant. There are four reasons for this.\n\n1. The average person has about as much idea about how long ago things are compared with how far things are. People know dinosaurs existed very long ago, but exactly how long? The average joe on the street doesn\u2019t have a concrete idea. So linking distances to times doesn\u2019t make too much sense.  \n\n2. It encourages confusion. There are countless times I had to explain that, even though the light was emitted 70 million years ago, the dinosaurs wouldn\u2019t have seen what we\u2019re seeing because of causality.  \n\n3. The light travel times of local universe objects (I\u2019m calling local universe anything below z=0.1) is quite irrelevant because the universe didn\u2019t change that much in the meantime. The universe we\u2019re detecting might as well be \u2018now\u2019. It\u2019s more meaningful to describe SN1987A as happening 35 years ago rather than thousands of years ago. For high redshift objects sure\u2014the properties of these objects are different that the look back time is relevant, but not local galaxies.  \n\n4. It doesn\u2019t actually explain anything usually. Since distance units in science communication is usually light years, you\u2019re essentially replacing the unit in distance with the unit in time, with the same value. This doesn\u2019t actually reduce the issue of big numbers to the layman, but actually just kicks the can down the road. If people know what light-year means, then adding the sentence about the light travel time doesn\u2019t add anything to the discussion.  \n\nI look forward to hearing your opinions on this.",

But I have none at the moment, so.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s surprisingly hard to find info on tropical location astronomy, or maybe I\u2019m just not searching it right, but I\u2019ve always been curious. I live in the southern hemisphere, so the Moon looks a particular way to me: you can see the maria swirling anti-clockwise leaving a tail, and Tycho the crater looks like the Moon\u2019s mouth, like a bottle. Also, the moon \u201cfills up\u201d left to right, like how we write (ignore upside Northerner-created down emoji): \ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf18\ud83c\udf17\ud83c\udf16\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf14\ud83c\udf13\ud83c\udf12\ud83c\udf11. Moon occasional tilt not included of course.\n\nIn the Northern hemisphere it is, of course, upside down. The maria look like it\u2019s swirling clockwise, Tycho looks like the Moon\u2019s butthole (explains the term mooning I guess), and the moon fills from right to left, like many Semitic alphabets: \ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf12\ud83c\udf13\ud83c\udf14\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf16\ud83c\udf17\ud83c\udf18\ud83c\udf11.\n\nIt all makes sense, of course, you\u2019re seeing a ball from the different hemispheres of a sphere. However things get whacky when you see it from the equator? I\u2019ve been to more equatorial latitudes a few times, but never by long enough to see the full moon cycle, like I have from higher latitudes in the northern and southern hemispheres, and I have never seen a full Moon there. The times I\u2019ve seen the moon, they were either waxing or crescent, can\u2019t remember exactly    which, but I distinctly remember them looking very prominently tilted, and very strong horns - both pointing upwards and pointing downwards, and maybe the moon was\u2026 sideways? As in, Tycho was the moon\u2019s navel. Hard to tell from so little being illuminated.\n\nWhen I Google tropical latitude moons I get all sorts of moons, you\u2019d think the tropical moon is random. Does it fill from bottom up then just rotates 45\u00b0 and does a pirouette? I don\u2019t know, the internet doesn\u2019t seem to be eager to answer that either.",
